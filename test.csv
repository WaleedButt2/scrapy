Lord Cameron said Palestinians had to be given a political horizon to encourage peace in the Middle East. He is beginning his fourth visit to the region since being appointed foreign secretary in November . The UK has a responsibility to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, he told a Westminster reception. The Palestinian people would have to be shown ""irreversible progress"" towards a two-state solution, Lord Cameron said. ""As that happens, we - with allies - will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations,"" he told the Conservative Middle East Council. ""That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."" Image source, Reuters Image caption, Lord Cameron has urged Israel to allow more humanitarian support into Gaza The foreign secretary also urged Israel to allow more humanitarian support into Gaza and said it was ""ludicrous"" that vital British and other aid was being sent back at the border. Lord Cameron said the last 30 years had been a story of failure for Israel because it had failed to provide security to its citizens. Only by recognising that failure, he said, would there be peace and progress. Image source, Downing Street Image caption, Foreign Secretary David Cameron met President of Israel Isaac Herzog in November Britain has long supported a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians could live side by side in separate countries. But Lord Cameron is suggesting Britain could give formal, diplomatic recognition to a Palestinian state not as part of a final peace deal, but earlier, during the negotiations themselves. At the same time, there would have to be a new Palestinian authority ""stood up quickly"" with ""technocratic and good leaders"" able to govern Gaza, he said. Lord Cameron added: ""Together with that, almost most important of all, is to give the Palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state. ""We have a responsibility there because we should be starting to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, what it would comprise, how it would work and crucially, looking at the issue, that as that happens, we with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations. ""That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."" As part of any long-term deal, the foreign secretary said Israel would need to see all hostages released, with a guarantee that Hamas could not launch attacks on Israel and its leadership had left Gaza. He said a deal would be ""difficult"" but not impossible. Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian mission in London, said Lord Cameron's comments were ""historic"", because for first time the UK was considering recognising a Palestinian state ""as a contribution to a peaceful solution rather than an outcome"". However, the idea of fast-tracking Palestinian statehood prompted anger from some Conservative MPs. Former minister Theresa Villiers told the Commons ""bringing forward and accelerating unilateral recognition of Palestinian state would be to reward Hamas' atrocities"". Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said the government would not recognise a Palestinian state ""bilaterally"" but would do so ""at a time when it best serves the objective of peace"". The Israeli government has yet to comment. Foreign secretary supports 'sustainable ceasefire' and warns over deaths Israel should turn water back on in Gaza - Lord Cameron On the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza, Lord Cameron said a pause in the fighting was needed now and there were ""hopeful signs"" about the negotiations under way. ""There is a path that we can now see opening up where we really can make progress, not just in ending the conflict, but progress in finding a political solution that can mean peace for years rather than peace for months,"" he said. The real challenge would be to ""turn that pause into a sustainable ceasefire without a return to the fighting, he said. ""That is the prize we should be looking for, and more than that, not just how you go from pause to sustainable ceasefire, but how you go from there to a set of political moves and arrangements that could start to deliver the longer term political solution,"" Lord Cameron said. ""Although it is incredibly difficult, although efforts in the past have failed, we cannot give up. ""If the last 30 years tells us anything, it is a story of failure. ""Ultimately it is a story of failure for Israel because yes, they had a growing economy, yes they had rising living standards, yes they invested in defence and security and walls and the rest of it, but they couldn't provide what a state most wants, what every family wants, which is security. ""And so the last 30 years has been a failure. ""And it is only by recognising that failure and recognising that true peace and progress will come when the benefits of peace and progress are greater than the benefits of returning to fighting.""

1,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-underlines-commitment-to-cut-net-migration,"Measures to transform the UK’s legal migration system, bolster border security and drive down unsustainable and unfair levels of migration will come into force within weeks, the Home Secretary has announced today.  It comes after the Prime Minister and Home Secretary set out a major new package of reforms in December, delivering the biggest ever reduction in net migration and tackling exploitation across the immigration system.  The robust changes, which will curb abuse of the migration system, and ensure those choosing to make the UK their home can afford to do so, will begin to come into effect as early as March and will mean 300,000 people who came to the UK last year would now not be able to come.  They include:  reforms that will restrict care workers from bringing dependants and require care providers to register with the Care Quality Commission if they are sponsoring migrants, which will come into force on 11 March  the laying of Immigration Rules, which will include the removal of the 20% going rate discount for occupations on the Shortage Occupation List on 14 March  a new increase to the minimum salary required for those arriving on the Skilled Worker visa, from £26,200 to £38,700, on 4 April  increasing the minimum income requirement threshold in stages for family visas, starting at £29,000 from 11 April  Reforms to student visas came into force at the start of January, ending the ability of nearly all postgraduate students to bring dependants to the UK.  The measures will crack down on rising migration, help curb the abuse of the Health and Care visa route, where we have seen people come to the UK for care worker jobs that do not exist or are paid significantly less than the required salary for a migrant worker on this route, and ensure British labour is not undercut by overseas workers.  Home Secretary James Cleverly said:  I’ve been clear that migration is too high and we must get back to sustainable levels. Last year I set out robust measures to reduce the numbers coming into our country – tightening the rules on care workers, skilled workers, and making sure that people can support their family members that they bring over. It is a firm approach, but a fair one, and gives those affected time to prepare whilst ensuring that migration comes down. The British people want to see action, not words. We are delivering the change we promised and which they expect, lifting pressure on public services and protecting British workers with the utmost urgency.  Tom Pursglove MP, Minister for Legal Migration and the Border, said:  Our comprehensive plan to tackle net migration will not only bring numbers down substantially, but also tackles the inherent unfairness of a system which, if left untouched, would reward employers seeking to recruit cheap labour from overseas at the expense of the British worker. Delivering change on this scale and at such a pace is hard and challenging work, but we’re making strong headway, with further improvements to modernise and enhance the security of the UK border continuing throughout 2024.  Helen Whately, Minister of State for Social Care said:  We’re grateful to overseas care workers but I’m clear that immigration is not the long-term answer to our social care needs. That’s why alongside tightening visa rules we’re reforming social care careers to boost our homegrown care workforce. We have launched the first ever national career path for care workers and a new care qualification is on the way. These reforms, together with international recruitment under the new rules, will build on the progress made over the last year - of lower staff turnover, fewer vacancies and more people working in social care.  From 4 April, the increase to the minimum salary required for those arriving on the Skilled Worker visa, from £26,200 to £38,700, will come into force. This 48% rise will drive down numbers, reduce pressure on public services and prevent the undercutting of British workers by employers who look to recruit cheap labour from overseas. Workers on a Health and Care visa and on health and education national pay scales will be exempt from this specific threshold.  Meanwhile, the laying of the new Immigration Rules on 14 March will include the removal of the 20% going rate discount for occupations on the Shortage Occupation List, which will be abolished in favour of a new Immigration Salary List from early April. This follows a recommendation from the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which will now advise government on which occupations should be temporarily added to the new list initially, in time for March.  The minimum income requirement for family visas will rise in stages to give predictability to families, starting at £29,000 from 11 April. By early 2025 this will have increased to £38,700, ensuring only dependants that can be supported financially are brought to the UK.  The major transformation to legal migration comes as the Home Office continues to deliver the Prime Minister’s priority to stop the boats and drive down illegal migration. Small boats crossings are down by 46% last year with more than 24,000 people who have no right to be in the UK have been returned.  The government also takes a significant step forward in the long-term modernisation and enhancement of the UK border’s security, with the electronic travel authorisation (ETA) scheme opening for the remaining nationals of the Gulf states and Jordan on Thursday 1 February.  ETAs are a new requirement for passengers visiting or transiting through the UK, who do not currently need a visa for short stays or who do not already have any other UK immigration status. It will continue to be rolled out, worldwide, throughout 2024. Once fully implemented, the scheme will enable a more efficient customer experience and cement the UK as a world leader in border security.  From tomorrow (31 January), the government is also enhancing how the UK does business with the rest of the world. Reforms to the visit visa will be implemented, expanding the permitted activities to make it easier to do business in the UK.  These changes demonstrate the government’s commitment to welcome those who are here to contribute their skills and talents to our society and economy.  Those who come must be willing to contribute to the country. In keeping with this, those who use and benefit from public services, such as the NHS, should make a sufficient financial contribution towards the cost of those services. From 6 February, the Immigration Health Surcharge will be raised by 66% to £1,035. The new rate reflects increases in healthcare expenditure and better reflects the NHS use by migrants, who are provided with near comprehensive access to health services in return.","Home Secretary underlines commitment to cut net migration - GOV.UK Skip to main content Cookies on GOV.UK We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

2,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2450521/middle-east,"LONDON: The UK could expedite recognition of a Palestinian state in a bid to bring peace to the region, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said.  Ahead of a visit to the Middle East, he told a reception held by the Conservative Middle East Council in Westminster that the Palestinian people need to see “irreversible progress” toward a two-state solution.  “As that happens, we — with allies — will look at the issue of recognizing a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations,” he told attendees. “That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible.”  He added, though, that recognition would require a new Palestinian government with “technocratic and good leaders” to be “stood up quickly” to bring order to the Gaza Strip.

The US and UK have kept up missile strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen after a British-linked oil tanker was attacked on Friday.  Meanwhile, fears continue of broader regional escalation after three US troops were killed in Jordan at the weekend in a drone attack conducted by an Iran-backed militia.  “The Houthis continue to attack ships in the Red Sea, risking lives, delaying vital aid getting to the Yemeni people and disrupting global trade,” Cameron said.  “We can’t ignore the risk that the conflict in Gaza spreads, spilling over borders into other countries in the region.  “We’ll do everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen — escalation and instability is in nobody’s interests. In Gaza, there’s an urgent need for an immediate pause to allow aid in and hostages out.  “We’re determined to do all we can to press for a sustainable ceasefire, and are stepping up our engagement with countries in the region to make sure that happens.”","Cameron floats prospect of UK recognition of Palestinian state | Arab News Arab News Arab News PK Arab News JP Arab News FR Tuesday .  January 30, 2024 Search form Search Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Search form Search Latest News Middle-East Football Business & Economy Saudi Arabia Lantern workshops illuminate Cairo as Ramadan approaches Quintet nations hold talks with Lebanese parliament speaker in effort to resolve presidential deadlock Guardiola still loving ‘dream’ Man City job as Haaland returns Bayern Munich in talks to bring Bryan Zaragoza signing forward amid injury crisis Iraq foreign minister condemns attack on US military outpost in Jordan Qatari PM, US secretary of state meet in Washington Global M&A market drops 15% in 2023 to $3.2tn Palestinians in Lebanon protest halt in funding to UN agency King Abdulaziz Library, ALECSO sign agreement to share knowledge English soccer authorities vow to stamp out fan trouble after West Brom-Wolves incident Previous Pause Next You are here Home Cameron floats prospect of UK recognition of Palestinian state Cameron floats prospect of UK recognition of Palestinian state /node/2450521/middle-east Cameron floats prospect of UK recognition of Palestinian state British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.

In Gaza, there’s an urgent need for an immediate pause to allow aid in and hostages out. “We’re determined to do all we can to press for a sustainable ceasefire, and are stepping up our engagement with countries in the region to make sure that happens.” Follow Topics: Palestine Gaza Red Sea Houthis Yemen US UK War on Gaza Related Special 770 Middle-East Houthis claim attack on US Navy ship in Gulf of Aden 14110 Middle-East Houthis accuse US, UK of targeting Ras Isa oil terminal in Hodeidah Lantern workshops illuminate Cairo as Ramadan approaches /node/2450971/middle-east Lantern workshops illuminate Cairo as Ramadan approaches Updated 10 sec ago Mohammad Shamaa January 30, 2024 20:53 277 Follow Lantern workshops illuminate Cairo as Ramadan approaches Among the most famous places for making the lanterns is the Sayeda Zeinab area, located in the center of the city Updated 10 sec ago Mohammad Shamaa January 30, 2024 20:53 277 CAIRO: With the holy month of Ramadan approaching, workshops in Cairo crafting lanterns or “Fawanis” have begun operations in the old districts of the Egyptian capital. Among the most famous places for making the lanterns is the Sayeda Zeinab area, located in the center of the city. Ahmed Abdel Aal, a worker at Al-Asdeqa workshop in the area, told Arab News: “We started manufacturing lanterns two weeks ago, specifically at the beginning of the month of Rajab. The products from here go to shops all over the country, but most of our items are sent to the Husseini area in Cairo.” He added: “The shapes of the lanterns have not changed much from last year, but there is a slight change in the printing on the lantern. The sizes vary according to the demands of the shops and customers.” Jamal Farouk, another worker, said: “Most of the lanterns we make are metal ones having a slot for a candle. It is the cheapest type and easiest to manufacture. “We manufacture quantities of lantern parts in fixed sizes, which are then assembled at the end to form the well-known shape of the lantern. “Each workshop in the Sayeda Zeinab and Gamaliya areas (in central Cairo) is famous for a particular lantern shape. “There are various types including Tower, Abu Walad and Farouk lanterns. Other types are Lotus, Dala’a, Shamama and Shaq Battikha. Sometimes, on order, we manufacture a lantern as tall as two meters. “The shape and size of a lantern determine its price, and the larger it gets, the more expensive it becomes.” Describing market conditions, Farouk said: “The prices of materials this year have skyrocketed, which will raise the price of lanterns to double or more than double that of last year.” Sayed Jamal, a workshop owner, said: “The lantern has its value to me, bringing joy and happiness to the hearts of both adults and children. The manufacturing time for a regular lantern is two hours, and larger lanterns take longer. “The largest lantern I made on order was two and a quarter meters tall, named ‘Sheikh of Lanterns,’ adorned with small lanterns on the sides.” Jamal added: “The last lantern I made of this size was for a person who wanted to gift it to his recently married daughter. “Adults and children come to us, as do our Coptic brothers, who give the lanterns to their Muslim friends in celebration of Ramadan, as the item is a custom and not related to faith.” Follow Topics: Ramadan 2024 Egypt Related 231 Business & Economy Egypt mulling bond issuance in multiple currencies: minister of finance 335 Middle-East Egypt, Jordan say only comprehensive solution to Palestinian cause can guarantee regional peace Quintet nations hold talks with Lebanese parliament speaker in effort to resolve presidential deadlock /node/2450961/middle-east Quintet nations hold talks with Lebanese parliament speaker in effort to resolve presidential deadlock A view shows the parliament building on a rainy day in downtown Beirut, Lebanon January 25, 2024.

The gathering was described as a “coordinative meeting to exchange proposals and listen to Berri's views without issuing any position on behalf of the committee.” The presidency has been vacant since Michel Aoun’s term ended in October 2022, as politicians have been unable to agree on a replacement. The Quintet Committee on Lebanon includes representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, the US and France. Its efforts to help break the political deadlock in the presidential selection process, and implement the political and economic reforms required to unlock international funding for the crisis-hit nation, began during a meeting in February last year in Paris. A second meeting of the committee, which took place in Doha in July, concluded with a statement urging all Lebanese parties to fulfill their responsibilities by reaching a consensus on a suitable choice for president who is not tainted by allegations of corruption. The participants also discussed ways in which reforms could be implemented to satisfy conditions set by the International Monetary Fund and clear the way for international aid to help the country resolve its long-running economic crisis. The outbreak of the war in Gaza in October has added to an already complex situation surrounding the selection of a new president, with Hezbollah and the Amal Movement linking the process to events in Gaza, and in southern Lebanon where there are ongoing clashes between Israeli and Hezbollah forces. During the meeting on Tuesday, Berri was joined by the Saudi ambassador to Lebanon, Walid Bukhari, and the envoys from Qatar, Sheikh Saud bin Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Thani, Egypt, Alaa Moussa, France, Herve Magro, and the US, Lisa Johnson. According to reports, no specific choices of presidential candidates were discussed because that is considered a matter for the Lebanese to decide. Following the meeting, Magro said: “The ambassadors are in agreement and will soon meet with political officials in Lebanon.” Berri said: “The position was unified and the meeting was useful and promising.” Hezbollah and the Amal Movement support former minister Suleiman Franjieh in the presidential election, while opposition parties are rallying behind Gen. Joseph Aoun, whose term as army commander was extended for a year in December. He had been due to vacate the post in January but there was no agreement between political faction on who should fill the important position. During 12 previous electoral sessions, the parliament failed to get past a first round of voting. The most recent attempt by politicians to select a new president took place in June last year. Jihad Azour, a former finance minister backed by the Lebanese Forces and the Free Patriotic Movement, received 59 votes, while Franjieh, Hezbollah’s preference, received 51. Neither of them reached the threshold of 86 votes, a two-thirds majority of the 128 MPs, required for victory in the first round of voting. If a second round is needed, the threshold falls to 65 votes. However, a quorum of two-thirds of MPs is required for any vote to take place, and previous voting sessions have broken down when Hezbollah MPs and their allies walked out after the first round. According to reports, “there are deliberative endeavors and ideas focused on reaching an agreement on a comprehensive settlement in Lebanon, linked to restructuring the political power and which takes into consideration the situation in southern Lebanon and the restoration of stability.” Other reports have stated that “the Quintet Committee prefers to separate the presidential election file from the Gaza war developments” given that Hezbollah has on several occasions said it does not link the conflict with Israel to the presidential vacancy. Meanwhile, hostilities along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel continued for a 115th day, despite bitterly cold weather. Hezbollah said on Tuesday it had targeted “a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the surroundings of the Hadeb Yarin outpost, using missiles.” The militant group also said its “sniper force directly targeted spying equipment adjacent to the Wazzani village on Tuesday afternoon.” The Israeli army shelled the outskirts of several border villages in Lebanon, while warplanes attacked the village of Aita Al-Shaab and areas on the outskirts of Mays Al-Jabal and Houla, reportedly targeting residential properties.

The meeting focused on ways to strengthen strategic relations between the two states, Qatar News Agency said. The two officials also discussed the most recent developments in Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and the importance of finding a long-term solution to the Palestinian issue. They also emphasized the importance of delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and solving recent regional escalation elsewhere. Qatar has served as the main mediator between Hamas and Israeli officials during the conflict. In November, Qatar helped secure a seven-day pause in fighting, during which 110 Israeli and foreign hostages were released from Gaza in return for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Sheikh Mohammed expressed Qatar’s appreciation for its close partnership with the US, adding that the two countries intended to expand this partnership in various areas. Meanwhile, he expressed deep concern about the latest developments in the region, condemning the targeting of a US military base in Jordan at the weekend. Sheikh Mohammed extended Qatar’s condolences to the victims’ families, the US government and the American people, and wished the injured a speedy recovery.

At least 12 key donor countries have said they will halt funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency following the accusations, while UNRWA has fired several employees and promised a thorough investigation into the claims. “We are afraid for the future of UNRWA,” said Palestinian refugee Abu Mohammed, 65, who attended the protest organized by Hamas in Lebanon. “All our children study in UNRWA schools and most of our medical care is covered by the agency,” he said, urging countries “to reverse their decision.” “The suspension of aid would be catastrophic from a social and humanitarian perspective,” he added. UNRWA is charged with providing humanitarian aid and protection for Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem. Tiny Lebanon hosts an estimated 250,000 Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, while almost double that number are registered for the organization’s services. Most live in poverty. “Even though I have a job, UNRWA helps me pay my rent and buy food,” said Dima Dahouk, 40, a Palestinian and the sole breadwinner for her four children. “My son who dreams of becoming an engineer had to temporarily drop out of school” to help support the family, she said. “The situation is terrible,” she added, amid a four-year economic crisis in Lebanon that has plunged most of the population into poverty. Aid groups on Tuesday condemned the countries that suspended funding to UNRWA, pointing to a “worsening humanitarian catastrophe” and “looming famine” in Gaza. The World Health Organization warned the funding row was distracting from the humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territory. Raafat Al-Murra, a Hamas official in Lebanon, said the UNRWA funding crisis had “dangerous repercussions for Palestinian refugees, particularly in Lebanon, where they depend mainly on UNRWA in the absence of aid from the Lebanese state.” “We have called on the United Nations to take urgent measures... and look for more financing,” he said. Around 5.9 million Palestinians are registered with UNRWA and can access health care, social services, microfinance and emergency aid. The deadliest-ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Israel’s relentless military offensive has killed at least 26,751 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.

There were 25,158 firms across England and Wales that went bust in 2023 - up 14 per cent on 2022 and the highest annual number since 1993, the Insolvency Service said on Tuesday.  The number of voluntary liquidations (CVLs) leapt by 9 per cent to 20,577, marking the highest since records began in 1960.  In terms of the rate, 53.7 per 10,000 active companies went involvent in 2023, an increase from 49.6 in 2022. However the figure is still far lower than the peak rate of 94.8 insolvencies during the 2008 credit crunch.  The stark figures illustrate the succession of economic pressures that businesses have faced in the last year, including higher interest rates, skyrocketing energy and staff wage bills, while they also grappled with falling consumer confidence.  The Bank of England is likely to keep interest rates at 5.25% this week but later cuts may come (Yui Mok/PA) (PA Wire)  Experts have warned that the high-level of insolvencies mean the trading environment in the UK remains “pretty onerous” and businesses are facing conditions that form a “perfect storm for financial distress”.  Labour said this was yet more evidence of Tory “economic failure” and the Liberal Democrats said that under Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt’s watch British businesses have “withered away”.  Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said this was yet more evidence of “14 years of Conservative economic failure.”  He added: “The Tories have left Britain with flatlining growth, high taxes and now British business shutting their doors for good at record levels.  “It's time for change. Labour has a plan to back British business, reforming business rates, lowering energy bills and reviving the great British high street.”  Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney MP said that under Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt’s watch, British businesses have “withered away” and communities left “without vital shops and services”.  The data also showed a 14 per cent year-on-year increase in insolvencies to 6,788 in the last three months of last year - the highest since the end of 2008. This was also 9 per cent higher than the previous quarter.  Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “It’s the worst set of figures in over 30 years, which demonstrates just how tough it was for many businesses. On top of this, 47,000 UK businesses started 2024 on the edge of collapse according to our most recent Red Flag Alert report, all of which points to further trouble this year.  The three industries with the highest levels of insolvencies last year were construction, wholesale and retail and accomodation and food services. (Gareth Fuller/PA) (PA Archive)  “Thousands of businesses have been pushed into insolvency due to a combination of interest rates at levels we haven’t seen in over a decade, pushing the cost of borrowing up, alongside inflation, weak consumer confidence and rising input costs – a perfect storm for financial distress.  “That being said, a better-than-expected Christmas may delay concerns for some companies and today’s fall in shop price inflation, together with signals from the Bank of England that interest rates may start to fall, also provide some comfort for business leaders already worried about their future.  “With more businesses entering insolvency in 2023 than during the financial crisis, economic conditions must improve quickly, otherwise the fight for survival in 2024 might be a step too far for the battered and debt-laden businesses that managed to survive last year.”  The three industries with the highest levels of insolvencies last year were construction, wholesale and retail and accomodation and food services.  Restructuring expert Mark Ford, at professional services firm Evelyn Partners, said: “While in terms of interest rates and prices the general feeling might be that the worst is over, the trading environment for businesses in the UK remains pretty onerous.  “We can expect the costs environment for some firms to become more challenging, particularly but not exclusively in construction, retail, leisure and healthcare sectors.  “It also looks like the crisis in the Middle East might start to choke supply chains, lengthen lead times and possibly restrict the supply of imported materials and components.”  Jeremy Whiteson, Restructuring and Insolvency Partner at law Fladgate, added it was “a worrying situation.”  He said: “Many companies are facing the attritional damage from a series of financial shocks- the pandemic; Brexit, shortages and high prices for labour, power and many commodities; overseas conflicts; high interest rates; and anaemic growth denting consumer confidence. This is bound to take its toll on UK businesses.”  The figures come just days before the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at 5.25 per cent, with policymakers under pressure to start cutting rates later in the year.","Man 'threatening people with crossbow' shot dead by police in southeast London | UK News | Sky News Skip to content Sky News - back to home 31 Jan 9° 7° Watch Live Home UK World Israel-Hamas War Politics US Climate Science & Tech Business Ents & Arts Travel Offbeat Analysis Data & Forensics Videos Programmes Weather More Home UK World Israel-Hamas War Politics US Climate Science & Tech Business Ents & Arts Travel Offbeat Analysis Data & Forensics Videos Programmes Weather Man 'threatening people with crossbow' shot dead by police in southeast London The man, believed to be in his 30s, was reportedly armed with weapons including a crossbow and was threatening to harm residents inside an address in Southwark in London, according to police.

It said preserving public services and investment implied higher spending than was reflected in the government's current plans. The IMF suggested the Treasury's pencilled-in spending cuts from this year were unrealistic. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said tax cuts could be a big help in boosting growth. Mr Hunt has hinted heavily about more tax cuts in his upcoming Budget in March. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries, including the UK. They work together to try to stabilise the global economy. One of the Fund's jobs is to advise its members on how to improve their economies. What is the IMF and why does it matter? How will the UK economy compare to others in 2024? The latest comments from the IMF came as it downgraded its forecasts for UK growth next year from 2% to 1.6%, partly as a statistical consequence of growth having been revised higher during the pandemic years. This better performance leaves less room for growth to catch up in later years. The UK's growth last year and this year is expected to remain sluggish at below 0.5% and 0.6% respectively, the second-slowest in the G7 major economies, behind Germany. The IMF also assumes fewer Bank of England rate cuts than in financial markets, calculating that rates will remain at 5.25% in the first half of this year. The Bank is then expected to cut by half a per cent over the second half of the year. Treasury sources said the government was slapping down the IMF for its advice on tax cuts, which derives from the organisation's research for its annual in-depth health check of the UK economy. It comes at a sensitive time ahead of the Budget and a general election where the chancellor hopes to mark out a key dividing line with the opposition on a smaller state, with lower public spending and lower taxes. The Treasury sources said that the improvement in UK growth prospects arose because of the chancellor's targeted business investment tax cuts. On Tuesday, Mr Hunt receives the first draft of the numbers on the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's independent forecaster - including an indication of the room for manoeuvre that might be used for tax cuts or spending increase. OBR head Richard Hughes recently said a description of the government's pencilled-in post-election spending plans as a ""work of fiction"" was ""generous"" because the ""government hasn't even bothered to write down"" its plans for individual departments. If the government sticks to its spending plans, then lower interest rates, and a stronger economy could increase the chancellor's room for manoeuvre against his self-imposed borrowing targets by as much as £20bn per year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said last week that promises of tax cuts during general election campaigns may have to be rolled back as the UK economy faces some of its worst problems since the 1950s. Politicians need to be honest about tough economic trade-offs, it said. Following the IMF's forecast, Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, told the BBC the chancellor was ""only barely on track to meet his own central objective of having government debt on a downward trajectory in five years' time"". ""[Tax cuts should] at least wait until we have debt more securely on a downward trajectory, and much more clarity about where planned spending cuts will bite,"" he said. Commenting on the IMF's advice, Mr Hunt said: ""The IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives. ""It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth."" But Labour's Darren Jones, shadow chief secretary, said the IMF's forecast was ""yet more evidence of 14 years of Conservative economic failure"". ""The Tories have left Britain with high debt, flatlining growth, high taxes and working people worse off,"" he said. The IMF and UK government have disagreed over previous forecasts. In October last year, the IMF rejected government suggestions that its assessment of the UK back then was too gloomy. But economic forecasters are not always right when it comes to predicting the future. The IMF has previously stated its forecasts for most advanced economies, such as the UK's, have more often than not been within about 1.5 percentage points of what actually happens. Global outlook Elsewhere, the IMF predicted that the world economy could be on the path to a ""soft landing"" with lower inflation and more resilient growth. It now expects growth of 3.1% this year, rather than the 2.9% it predicted in October, because of the resilience of the US and a strong performance from developing economies such as Mexico and India. There was a notably large upgrade to its forecast for growth in Russia, which is now expected to expand 2.6% this year, ahead of an earlier 1.1% prediction. The expansion comes despite sanctions facing the country after its invasion of Ukraine, as high military spending boosts growth. China grew 5.2% last year and while it is not expected to do as well this year, the IMF's outlook on the country has brightened since October. It is now forecasting growth of 4.6%. However, the IMF cautioned that much depends on its deeply troubled property sector and how much support it gets from the Chinese government. This week's ordered liquidation of property giant Evergrande with $300bn (£236bn) of debt shows the scale of the problems it is now causing. Tensions in the Middle East represent another significant cause for concern, the IMF said. It said recent attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine could damage global trade. Amid these challenges, the IMF urged the world's central banks to focus on stabilising prices. Over the last year central banks have increased interest rates to try to slow inflation, the pace at which prices are rising. The IMF said it expected global inflation to fall from 6.8% last year to 5.8% this year, with advanced economies seeing the biggest drops. As well as higher rates, the organisation said lower energy prices would help to drive down inflation.  It said slower wage growth, as companies find it easier to recruit new staff, would also help to ease price rises.

Media caption, Sinn Féin's Michelle O’Neill says next days will be 'crucial' in restoring power-sharing. The stage is set for the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) endorsed a deal to restore power sharing. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal provided a basis for Stormont's return, subject to laws being passed. Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""day of optimism"". Details of the government deal with the DUP are due to be published on Wednesday. The DUP has blocked a functioning executive and assembly since February 2022, in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements. Unionists said checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom weakened Northern Ireland's place in the union. Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland after the last assembly election and will nominate Ms O'Neill for the position of first minister, with the DUP the second largest, entitling it to the role of deputy first minister. This will be the first time the Northern Ireland Assembly will have a nationalist first minister. A Stormont deal is agreed - what happens next? Follow latest updates on BBC News NI's live page What happens next? Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he will publish details of an agreement between the government and the DUP on Wednesday which will ""secure Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market"". Mr Heaton-Harris briefed parties on the content of the deal on Tuesday afternoon at Stormont Castle. Legislation could be passed in parliament on Thursday, leading to a potential assembly recall on Friday or Saturday. The first order of business would be to elect a new speaker - this must happen before any other business can be conducted. The DUP has been involved in talks to change the arrangements agreed in the UK-EU Windsor Framework deal. It has introduced additional checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which the DUP argued had undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK internal market. Sir Jeffrey said the new legislation would ""remove checks on goods moving within the UK and remaining in Northern Ireland, and end Northern Ireland blindly following EU laws"". This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, DUP deal: 'Green lane will go and goods will flow freely' He added: ""There will be legislation protecting the Acts of Union, which guarantees unfettered access for Northern Ireland business to the rest of the UK."" A Stormont deal is agreed - what happens next? As it happened:  Reaction as DUP endorses deal Regardless of who forms the next UK government, these measures will be taken as ""legislative commitments"", he said. ""Will we continue to fight for further change? Absolutely yes, we will,"" Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. He said his party's deal was not perfect but represented a ""good outcome"" for Northern Ireland. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon Sir Jeffrey said that what the deal achieved was  ""significant, including when measured against the DUP's seven tests"". He said that on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland there ""will no longer be physical checks or identity checks save where, as is normal anywhere in the UK, there are suspicions of smuggling of criminal activity"". ""On customs paperwork again, customs declarations, supplementary declarations will be gone and we believe this represents a significant change."" Image source, PA Media Image caption, TUV members were among the protesters who gathered outside the DUP executive meeting on Monday night Despite the remote venue for the DUP meeting on Monday being kept secret, senior party members were confronted by protesters holding placards calling them ""sell-outs"". A DUP executive member behind a leak of the meeting was wearing a wire which relayed the party leader's speech to loyalist activist Jamie Bryson, BBC News NI understands. Mr Bryson then posted an account of the meeting on social media. ""Obviously I wasn't in the room, the venue clearly wasn't bugged by some hidden device so there was clearly senior people - plural - within the DUP who felt so strongly about this that they took this extraordinary, unprecedented step,"" Mr Bryson explained. Sir Jeffrey said whoever was responsible for leaking information from Monday's executive meeting was in ""fundamental breach"" of the party's rules. Sir Jeffrey said, if he discovers who was responsible for the leak, they will face disciplinary action. ""We would absolutely deal with that in line with our internal disciplinary procedures,"" he told BBC Newsline. Mission accomplished? I think Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is pretty pleased with himself to get this over the line. A lot of people doubted whether this was going to be possible. I have to say, we were very much in that camp as that meeting stretched into five hours last night. There was a sense outside the gathering that things were not going well for the party leader. So, there was some surprise in the room when he did confirm that his party is on the path back to power sharing, on the condition, of course, that the legislation falls into place before then. Sir Jeffrey looked pretty relieved because I'm sure that meeting was bruising. There are still divisions within the party but I think he felt very much as if it was mission accomplished. But the challenge for Sir Jeffrey now will be to manage the fallout. Speaking in Stormont's Great Hall on Tuesday, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said she was pleased Northern Ireland was on the ""cusp of the restoration of government"". She added that Ms O'Neill's installation as Northern Ireland's first nationalist first minister will be a ""moment of great significance"". She said that it is a ""mark of extent of change in the north and right across Ireland"", but acknowledged that the ""sequencing"" of a return to power sharing still has to be agreed. 'Bittersweet' Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the DUP's deal brought ""bittersweet emotions"" because of the time Stormont has been absent. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the deal appeared to only meet three of the DUP's seven tests . Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) asembly member Matthew O'Toole described the events of Monday night as ""surreal"" but hoped it marked progress towards devolution. Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said there was a need to ""separate fact from fiction"" and accused the DUP of a ""tawdry climbdown"" in its deal with the government. 'Preserve peace' A US State Department spokesperson said they welcomed the news ""that important steps have been taken toward the full restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive at Stormont"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar both welcomed developments. Both leaders said they hoped this now paves the way for the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly, and that north-south ministerial meetings will resume again. Simon Coveney, Ireland's minister for enterprise, trade, and employment, said the Irish government has not seen a draft of a deal agreed between the DUP and the UK government. However, he said his government has ""been given reassurance that any new arrangements that are being put in place won't do anything to undermine the Windsor Framework or the trade agreements that have been put in place to facilitate trade between Ireland and UK and the EU and the UK"". Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Public transport staff are planning to strike on Thursday Sir Jeffrey said he gave his word to trade unions that pay awards to public sector workers would be prioritised when the institutions were restored. The Northern Ireland secretary had previously guaranteed funding of more than £3.3bn for a restored executive, including a £500m provision for public sector pay. Two years with no devolved government has caused increasing budgetary pressures. Budgets have been set in Westminster and no big policy or spending decisions could be made in Northern Ireland without ministers. Nurses, teachers, transport workers and civil servants were among more than 100,000 public sector works who staged a mass walk-out over pay a fortnight ago.

Ministers are considering introducing the requirement alongside a need for all applicants to show a two-year connection to the local area. They have also announced new powers to ban people from social homes for up to five years for anti-social behaviour. Those without the right to live in the UK are generally ineligible already. Labour's housing secretary Angela Rayner called the announcement ""absolute rubbish"", as some people already on waiting lists were waiting more than a decade to access social housing. Ministers were ""gaslighting people who can't get homes,"" she told ITV, adding ""they can't give British homes for British people"". Housing Minister Lee Rowley said the rules would ensure ""decent and hardworking people that have contributed to this country"" would get priority for social housing. He added it would also mean ""local law-abiding citizens in need have more access to a home,"" adding that social housing was ""finite"". A consultation on the plans will run until 26 March, with changes then delivered ""at the earliest opportunity"" by amending housing laws. What's happened to the government's housebuilding target? Gove: I will act against councils failing on housing Applications for social housing in England are determined by local councils, which can set their own eligibility terms. But they are required to follow some nationwide rules, including when putting people forward from their waiting lists to live in properties owned by housing associations. These generally require foreign nationals to have settled status in the UK and be eligible for state benefits to apply. Under the planned ""UK connection test"" they would also have to live in the UK for a continuous period of 10 years before qualifying. The government says this period is at the ""upper limit"" of the time that non-British citizens currently have to live in the UK before gaining settled status under the various routes to do so. This new test would not apply to Irish citizens, Commonwealth citizens with right of abode, or qualifying EU citizens. It would also not apply to refugees who come to the UK through designated safe and legal routes. The government has also set out plans for a blanket two-year local residency requirement. Many, but not all, councils currently enforce their own local connection tests. According to officials figures, 90% of lead tenants in new social housing lets in England were UK nationals - but the figures do vary between local areas. 'Three strikes' Under the planned rules shake-up, those punished for anti-social behaviour could be barred from social housing for up to five years. The government has said this will be subject to a ""three strikes and you're out"" policy, with three sanctions leading to a ban. Ministers will also look at introducing a maximum household income threshold for new social housing applications, which will not apply to existing tenants. The government has said it has no plans to change existing rules on how people who qualify for waiting lists are then prioritised for housing. Those who are given preference currently include the legally homeless, and people living in insanitary or overcrowded housing. There are also rules to ensure military veterans and those fleeing violence are not disadvantaged by residence requirements. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said ""serious policy and proper funding"" was required to deliver tens of thousands of social homes. Chief executive Kate Henderson added that social housing was ""all the more scarce because of huge cuts in government funding"" and the government's Right to Buy policy . The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it had raised concerns that extending qualification periods for social housing could lead to a rise in homelessness. Cllr Darren Rodwell, the group's housing spokesman, said the policy was ""symptomatic of our wider housing shortage"", and called for councils to be given financial flexibility to resume their ""historic role as a major builder of affordable homes"".

Iran summoned the British ambassador to Tehran to protest against the “baseless accusations” and sanctions by London.  “Following the continuation of the British regime’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Simon Shercliff, the British ambassador in Tehran, was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs … and was informed of our country’s strong protest”, the IRNA state news agency said on Tuesday.  While the statement did not explain the accusation against the United Kingdom, it said the director general of Western Europe at the Iranian foreign ministry, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, criticised the British government and said its actions were another “destructive and unconstructive” act towards Iran.  “This is a bitter historical irony that a country that is the founder and supporter of organised terrorist groups, drug trafficking, and criminal gangs wants to make accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its loyal and honest forces, who are at the forefront of fighting organised crimes,” the official, cited by IRNA, said.  The summons came after the UK announced sanctions on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Tehran.  The UK has also accused Iranian-linked groups of being behind a deadly attack on US troops in Jordan.  British Foreign Secretary David Cameron condemned the “attacks by Iran-aligned militia groups against US forces” and urged “Iran to de-escalate in the region”.  However, Iran denied the accusation that it had any links to the Jordan strike that killed three US personnel and that it was not looking for an “expansion” of the tensions in the Middle East.  “As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding [to] the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist [Israeli] regime and … they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran”, Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was cited as saying by IRNA on Monday.  “These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities, as well as the interests of their country and people.”  US President Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday that he had made a decision on responding to the attacks in Jordan and said he holds Iran “responsible, in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it”.","Iran summons British ambassador as tensions soar | Politics News | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Sign in Sign in Show navigation menu Navigation menu Search search protected by reCAPTCHA News Show more news sections Middle East Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Israel War on Gaza Features Opinion Video More Show more sections Economy Ukraine war Coronavirus Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Sport Podcasts play Live Click here to search search BREAKING At least 16 killed in Israeli strike on Deir el-Balah PRCS: Israeli troops storm Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis At least 26,751 killed in Gaza, including more than 11,000 children Click to pause breaking news ticker pause-square-background Close Breaking News Ticker close News | Politics Iran summons British ambassador as tensions soar The UK has accused Iran-backed groups of attacking a US base in Jordan, and imposed sanctions on a network linked to Iran.

The Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill poses a grave threat to the rule of law and human rights, setting a dangerous legal and constitutional precedent that seeks to elevate the government above the rule of law.  In December, the UK Supreme Court ruled that Rwanda cannot be considered safe. The ruling was based on comprehensive evidence, including findings by Human Rights Watch on Rwanda’s well-established track record of repression, abuse , and disregard for its international obligations. By legislating to ignore the ruling, this bill effectively tries to place the government above the law.  The government has tried to alleviate concerns about Rwanda’s dire human rights record, insisting that the scheme would be subject to rigorous oversight and monitoring mechanisms under the new treaty between the UK and Rwanda. But by legislating that Rwanda is safe and attempting to prevent courts from reconsidering Rwanda’s safety when hearing a case, any oversight will be wholly ineffective. Even if evidence is uncovered of widespread violations against asylum seekers, the proposed law would instruct decision-makers to ignore these facts and rubber stamp removals to Rwanda, except in the very limited case where they concern an asylum seekers’ personal situation.  The UK government is trying to shield itself from judicial scrutiny and accountability for its decisions that affect peoples’ rights, which sends a grave message that the government no longer respects basic principles of the rule of law.  The UK’s willingness to breach its international obligations has drawn attention. A number of foreign officials have privately expressed alarm to Human Rights Watch that the UK-Rwanda scheme undermines international refugee protections and the rules-based order. Other officials have accused the UK of hypocrisy, questioning why they should listen to the UK’s calls for them to uphold their obligations towards asylum seekers and refugees given its own poor record.  In the face of this dangerous bill, the House of Lords has a pivotal role to play in protecting the rule of law. The Lords should resist the bill being passed into law and send a clear message to the government that this cruel, costly, and unlawful scheme should be abandoned.","UK Should Abandon Dangerous, Authoritarian Rwanda Bill | Human Rights Watch Skip to cookie privacy notice Skip to main content Human rights abuses are happening right now – start a monthly gift today.

5,https://news.sky.com/story/dup-agrees-deal-with-uk-government-to-restore-devolved-parliament-to-northern-ireland-13059737,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has agreed a deal to restore power sharing to Northern Ireland, subject to legislation by the UK government.  The party collapsed the power-sharing government nearly two years ago in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland, subject to the UK government tabling and passing new legislative measures as agreed in negotiations.  He said the package of measures, once delivered, would provide the basis for the return of devolved government.  Sir Jeffrey said he believed the deal would safeguard Northern Ireland's place within the UK and crucially from the DUP's point of view, would remove checks on goods moving within the UK and remaining in Northern Ireland.  Analysis: Protests outside and leaks from inside but the deal to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland is done  What is power sharing and why is the system used?  But he warned that the DUP would only be able to move after the UK government delivers on implementing the agreement.  ""Both our party officers and party executive have mandated me to move forward... on the basis of the proposals brought forward by the government, subject to and on the basis of the government delivering measures of that package,"" he said.  Advertisement  Sir Jeffrey described the vote as ""decisive"" and, although the specific details of the deal have yet to be published, he said he was ""confident"" in the progress that had been achieved.  He also said that he believed the government could move ""quickly"" to bring forward legislation to implement what had been agreed.  Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Fein leader, said she was ""optimistic"" having heard the news from Sir Jeffrey.  ""Sinn Féin will now engage with the parties and both governments to ensure we now all press on without delay,"" she said.  ""It is vital there is political stability to address the scale of the crisis across our public services.  ""Let's now focus minds on the job at hand and to the solutions required to support workers and families who want and deserve functioning government.""  Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton Harris welcomed the step and made clear the government would deliver on its end of the deal.  But speaking to Sky News, Jamie Bryson, the editor of Unionist Voice, said he believed the agreement was ""going to fall apart as soon as the legislation is published"".  ""I think it's important that people understand the DUP executive were given a PowerPoint presentation last night. They did not see the legal text,"" he said.  ""I would love Sir Jeffrey's PowerPoint presentation to turn out to be accurate. Within the next 48 hours, either he's going to end up looking fairly foolish or I'm going to end up looking fairly foolish.""  Northern Ireland has a different type of governance from the rest of the UK in response to decades of conflict within the country.  Read more:  Northern Ireland set for another new deadline for power-sharing deal  Northern Ireland secretary vows to take 'pragmatic' legislative approach  What is in the new post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland?  The country operates under a power-sharing model devised as part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Unlike an agreed coalition, where at least two parties agree to govern together to form a government (like Britain's Conservative-Lib Dem coalition from 2010-15), it is mandatory for Northern Ireland's political parties to share power.  There must be representatives from both nationalist parties, who want Irish unity, and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.  The Northern Ireland Executive is made up of the first and deputy first ministers and their cabinet.  One of the top jobs at Stormont must be unionist and one nationalist, with equal powers, and one cannot be in position without the other.

The party collapsed the power-sharing government nearly two years ago in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland, subject to the UK government tabling and passing new legislative measures as agreed in negotiations. He said the package of measures, once delivered, would provide the basis for the return of devolved government. Sir Jeffrey said he believed the deal would safeguard Northern Ireland's place within the UK and crucially from the DUP's point of view, would remove checks on goods moving within the UK and remaining in Northern Ireland. Analysis: Protests outside and leaks from inside but the deal to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland is done What is power sharing and why is the system used? More on Dup DUP 'in position' to return to Stormont - if government sticks to its word Northern Ireland, cheese and fish: Why it's an important week in life after Brexit Northern Ireland set for another new deadline for power-sharing deal Related Topics: DUP Northern Ireland Sinn Fein But he warned that the DUP would only be able to move after the UK government delivers on implementing the agreement. ""Both our party officers and party executive have mandated me to move forward... on the basis of the proposals brought forward by the government, subject to and on the basis of the government delivering measures of that package,"" he said. Advertisement Sir Jeffrey described the vote as ""decisive"" and, although the specific details of the deal have yet to be published, he said he was ""confident"" in the progress that had been achieved. He also said that he believed the government could move ""quickly"" to bring forward legislation to implement what had been agreed. Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Fein leader, said she was ""optimistic"" having heard the news from Sir Jeffrey. ""Sinn Féin will now engage with the parties and both governments to ensure we now all press on without delay,"" she said. ""It is vital there is political stability to address the scale of the crisis across our public services. ""Let's now focus minds on the job at hand and to the solutions required to support workers and families who want and deserve functioning government."" Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton Harris welcomed the step and made clear the government would deliver on its end of the deal. But speaking to Sky News, Jamie Bryson, the editor of Unionist Voice, said he believed the agreement was ""going to fall apart as soon as the legislation is published"". ""I think it's important that people understand the DUP executive were given a PowerPoint presentation last night. They did not see the legal text,"" he said. ""I would love Sir Jeffrey's PowerPoint presentation to turn out to be accurate. Within the next 48 hours, either he's going to end up looking fairly foolish or I'm going to end up looking fairly foolish."" Northern Ireland has a different type of governance from the rest of the UK in response to decades of conflict within the country. Read more: Northern Ireland set for another new deadline for power-sharing deal Northern Ireland secretary vows to take 'pragmatic' legislative approach What is in the new post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland? The country operates under a power-sharing model devised as part of the Good Friday Agreement. Unlike an agreed coalition, where at least two parties agree to govern together to form a government (like Britain's Conservative-Lib Dem coalition from 2010-15), it is mandatory for Northern Ireland 's political parties to share power. There must be representatives from both nationalist parties, who want Irish unity, and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. The Northern Ireland Executive is made up of the first and deputy first ministers and their cabinet. One of the top jobs at Stormont must be unionist and one nationalist, with equal powers, and one cannot be in position without the other. With Sinn Fein now the biggest party, they will chose the first minister while the DUP will pick the deputy first minister. Certain decisions require cross-community support, including the election of the speaker and deputy speakers, and budget allocations. When the parliament finally convenes again electing a new speaker will be the first order of business as it cannot sit without one.

6,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67039975,"What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? Published 6 hours ago  Image source, Getty Images  Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October.  It began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history.  An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory.  What happened during the Hamas attacks on Israel?  On the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets.  The gunmen killed 1,200 people on the day and more than 100 later died from their injuries.  Those killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.  Hamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages.  The BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks.  What is Hamas and why is it fighting Israel?  Hamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.  It has an armed wing and was thought to have 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.  The group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction.  Hamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people.  These include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Hamas fighters on an Israeli tank captured in the 7 October attack  Hamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security.  It has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out other deadly attacks.  Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014.  Hamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others.  Iran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.  Why is Israel fighting in Gaza?  Israel immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.  Israel launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea.  Attacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas.  All 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety.  Following a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was extending ground operations to southern Gaza.  Troops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding.  Hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north were forced to move further south. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza.  More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It says most were women and children.  The IDF says it has killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel. It has not said how it came to this figure.  Israel says more than 200 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.  Homes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction.  Who are the hostages and how many have been freed?  Most of the 250 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians.  They included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old.  In Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups.  During November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.  Four hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and one rescued by the IDF.  Three hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters.  What is happening with Gaza civilians and hospitals?  Israel cut off supplies of food, water and fuel, to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages.  It led to severe shortages among Gaza's population.  Israel has since allowed in humanitarian aid, medicines and limited amounts of fuel.  However, the amount of aid getting into Gaza is well below pre-war levels.  Image source, Getty Images  The UN has accused Israel of obstructing the delivery of aid, while Israel has blamed the UN for problems.  In mid-January, the UN described the situation in Gaza as ""horrific"", with shelters overflowing, and food and water running out. It warned of a growing risk of famine.  Gaza's health system is in a state of collapse.  Only 16 out of its 36 hospitals are partially open.  They are overwhelmed by the huge number of injured and are struggling with shortages of staff, medical supplies, food, fuel and water.  Where is the Gaza Strip and how big is it?  The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.  Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War.  Israel withdrew its troops and about 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.  Home to 2.2 million people, it is one of the world's most densely populated places.  Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population are registered refugees, or descendants of refugees, the UN says.  Israel controls the air space over Gaza, its shoreline and its shared border, and limits the movement of people and goods.  What is Palestine?  The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories.  Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.  In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the UN the following year.  The West Bank - including East Jerusalem - and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have UN member status.  Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist refer to all of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza and Israel as Palestine.  The UN considers the West Bank and Gaza as a single Israeli-occupied territory.  However, the two areas are run by rival Palestinian administrations.  The West Bank is governed with limited self-rule by the Palestinian Authority (PA), under President Mahmoud Abbas, and Israel has overall control. The PA officially recognises Israel. Hamas, in Gaza, does not recognise Israel.  What is the two-state solution?  The future of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  An internationally backed plan for peace is known as the ""two-state solution"".  It would mean an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel.  Israel's most important ally, the US, sees a two-state solution as the way forward once the Gaza war ends.  A two-state solution is also formally supported by the PA.  However, since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The settlements are regarded as illegal by most of the rest of the world, though Israel disputes this.  The PA insists all settlements must be removed as part of any future peace deal.  The idea of a two-state solution has never been officially advocated by Israel, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly stated his opposition.","What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel Culture Future Music TV Weather Sounds Close menu BBC News Menu Home Israel-Gaza war War in Ukraine Climate Video World Asia UK Business Tech More Science Entertainment & Arts Health World News TV In Pictures BBC Verify Newsbeat World Africa Australia Europe Latin America Middle East US & Canada What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?

7,https://apnews.com/article/imf-uk-economy-tax-cuts-jeremy-hunt-3e6e12fff20c4b2dc177ae9d8d8c5ec8,"LONDON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund’s chief economist has advised the U.K. government to avoid further tax cuts amid expectations Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s battered administration will do just that to win over voters in an election year.  Instead of reducing taxes, the government should ensure it is prepared to meet increasing demands for spending on the National Health Service, social care and education as Britain faces sluggish economic growth and the lingering effects of high inflation, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters after the IMF released its latest outlook for the world economy.  U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt is widely expected to cut taxes in the coming months as part of an effort to boost support for his Conservative Party, which trails badly in most opinion polls. The next general election must be held by Jan. 28, 2025, and is expected to take place this year.  But Gourinchas said cutting taxes would be a mistake. Britain needs to make sure its finances are strong enough to accommodate increased spending demands without increasing debt as a proportion of economic output, he said.  “In that context, we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now,” Gourinchas said.  His comments came after the IMF downgraded its outlook for the U.K. economy, forecasting growth of 0.6% this year and 1.6% in 2025. In October, the IMF forecast that the U.K.’s gross domestic product would grow 2% in 2025.  Hunt is focusing on longer-term projections, noting that the IMF expects growth to strengthen over the next few years.  “It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth,” he said.  Concerns about responsible fiscal policies are especially sensitive for Sunak and Hunt as they came to power after their predecessors were widely criticized for announcing millions of pounds in tax cuts without saying how they would be paid for.  Former Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to resign after less than two months in office when concern about her policies sent the pound tumbling to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene in bond markets to protect pension funds.","Britain's Conservative government warned against tax cuts by IMF economist | AP News Enable accessibility EVEN WHEN THE NEWS IS FREE, JOURNALISM IS NOT.

8,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/imf-warns-british-government-against-more-tax-cuts.html,"British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said earlier this month the U.K. would not enter a recession this year.  LONDON — The U.K. government should not introduce further tax cuts this year, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, as its chief economist argued the national budget needed the money for public services and growth-friendly investments.  ""What we are seeing in the U.K. and a number of other countries is a need to put in place medium-term fiscal plans that will accommodate a significant increase in spending pressures,"" Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said during a press briefing.  In the U.K., he said, this included spending on the National Health Service, social care, education and the climate transition, as well as measures to boost growth, while preventing debt levels from increasing.  ""In that context, we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts, as envisioned or discussed now,"" he said.  An IMF spokesperson separately said the U.K. had higher spending needs across public services and investments than were currently reflected in the government's budget plans. The IMF has recommended the U.K. strengthens taxes on carbon emissions and property, eliminates loopholes in wealth and income taxation, and reforms rules which set pension levels.  British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt will announce his latest budget in early March, in what may be the last major fiscal announcement before a General Election is held. The timing of the vote is uncertain, but it must be called by the Conservative government at some point this year.  The Conservatives face an uphill battle, with the opposition Labour party ahead in most polls.  Hunt announced several tax cuts in his fall budget, and made several suggestions he wants to introduce more in the spring.  U.K. public sector net borrowing has fallen sharply, and in December 2023 was around half that of the prior year due to higher VAT (a sales levy) and income tax receipts and lower spending.  The IMF on Tuesday forecast 0.6% growth for the U.K. economy this year, up slightly from an estimated 0.5% figure for 2023. It revised its forecast for 2025 lower by 0.4 percentage points, to 1.6%, when it said disinflation will ease financial conditionals and allow real incomes to recover.","Britain's Conservative government warned against tax cuts by IMF economist | AP News Enable accessibility EVEN WHEN THE NEWS IS FREE, JOURNALISM IS NOT.

Instead of reducing taxes, the government should ensure it is prepared to meet increasing demands for spending on the National Health Service, social care and education as Britain faces sluggish economic growth and the lingering effects of high inflation, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters after the IMF released its latest outlook for the world economy . U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt is widely expected to cut taxes in the coming months as part of an effort to boost support for his Conservative Party, which trails badly in most opinion polls. The next general election must be held by Jan. 28, 2025, and is expected to take place this year. But Gourinchas said cutting taxes would be a mistake. Britain needs to make sure its finances are strong enough to accommodate increased spending demands without increasing debt as a proportion of economic output, he said. Other news UK fines HSBC bank for not going far enough to protect deposits in case it collapsed Northern Ireland political party agrees to end 2-year boycott and restore the mothballed government Church of England leader says a plan to send migrants to Rwanda undermines the UK’s global standing “In that context, we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now,” Gourinchas said. His comments came after the IMF downgraded its outlook for the U.K. economy, forecasting growth of 0.6% this year and 1.6% in 2025. In October, the IMF forecast that the U.K.’s gross domestic product would grow 2% in 2025. Hunt is focusing on longer-term projections, noting that the IMF expects growth to strengthen over the next few years. “It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth,” he said. Concerns about responsible fiscal policies are especially sensitive for Sunak and Hunt as they came to power after their predecessors were widely criticized for announcing millions of pounds in tax cuts without saying how they would be paid for. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to resign after less than two months in office when concern about her policies sent the pound tumbling to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene in bond markets to protect pension funds. by Taboola by Taboola Suggested For You Toyota urges owners of old Corolla, Matrix and RAV4 models to park them until air bags are replaced Proper Cloth Ad Content Advertisement Why do men love this shirt company?

9,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/northern-ireland-agreement-could-end-deadlock-restore-government,"The political deadlock in the region began after the United Kingdom left the European Union.  Northern Ireland’s largest British unionist party has agreed to end a boycott that left the region’s people without a power-sharing administration for two years and rattled the foundations of a 25-year-old peace treaty.  The breakthrough could see the shuttered Belfast government restored within days – with Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein holding the post of first minister for the first time.  After a marathon late-night meeting, Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said on Tuesday that the party’s executive branch had backed proposals to return to the government.  He said agreements reached with the United Kingdom’s government in London “provide a basis for our party to nominate members to the Northern Ireland Executive, thus seeing the restoration of the locally elected institutions”.  “The result was clear. The DUP has been decisive. I have been mandated to move forward,” Donaldson told reporters.  The breakthrough after months of inconclusive negotiations came after the UK government last week gave Northern Ireland politicians until February 8 to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly and the local government or face new elections.  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called it a “positive step” towards restoring the institutions and “delivering for the people of Northern Ireland,” his spokesman said.  Sunak’s Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told reporters that “all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return”, with little opposition expected in Westminster.  Advertisement  The deal contained “significant changes … to make sure our internal market works properly”, he added, saying he did not believe it would require renegotiations with the European Union.  Reporting from Belfast, Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett said that while the deal had not been finalised, it was a major step towards the power-sharing executive at Stormont, the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

It would also see Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill become first minister – the first time a nationalist has held the post after her party overtook the DUP in the last Assembly election in May 2022.  Mary Lou McDonald, leader of Sinn Fein, said that was of “very great significance” and she was optimistic the Assembly would be back up and running before the February deadline.  A key plank of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of sectarian violence over British rule in Northern Ireland, was to keep an open border with EU member the Republic of Ireland.  But after the UK decided to leave the EU and its borderless trading bloc after decades of membership, Northern Ireland began experiencing a political deadlock.  Advertisement  The DUP quit the government in opposition to new trade rules put in place after the UK left the EU in 2020 that imposed customs checks and other hurdles on goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.  The checks were established to maintain an open border between the north and the Republic of Ireland to the south. The DUP, though, says the new east-west customs border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the UK.  In February 2023, the UK and the EU agreed on a deal to ease customs checks and other hurdles for goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. But it was not enough for the DUP, which continued its government boycott.  The two-year hiatus also put pressure on stretched public services and led to a budget deadlock with London.  That triggered the biggest public sector strike in a generation this month after Northern Irish workers failed to receive pay increases given to others across the UK.  Steve Baker, a junior Northern Ireland minister, tried to pre-empt concerns that the changes might require the UK again to follow some EU regulations – which would infuriate advocates of Brexit.  “There are no commitments of any kind … to align GB (Great Britain) with EU law; prevent GB from diverging from any retained EU law; or increase alignment in Northern Ireland beyond the strictly limited scope parliament has approved,” he said on the social media platform X.  The Republic of Ireland’s prime minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, said his government and the European Commission still had to see the final deal to be confident it did not have any negative consequences for last year’s reworked post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland or the Good Friday Agreement.  But following a “good” phone call with his British counterpart, Rishi Sunak, Varadkar told Ireland’s parliament that he hoped a new government would be formed by February 8.","Northern Ireland agreement could end deadlock, restore government | Brexit News | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Sign in Sign in Show navigation menu Navigation menu Search search protected by reCAPTCHA News Show more news sections Middle East Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Israel War on Gaza Features Opinion Video More Show more sections Economy Ukraine war Coronavirus Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Sport Podcasts play Live Click here to search search BREAKING At least 16 killed in Israeli strike on Deir el-Balah PRCS: Israeli troops storm Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis At least 26,751 killed in Gaza, including more than 11,000 children Click to pause breaking news ticker pause-square-background Close Breaking News Ticker close News | Brexit Northern Ireland agreement could end deadlock, restore government The political deadlock in the region began after the United Kingdom left the European Union.

The DMEx will research, create, and prototype new materials for the armed forces that can survive in the harshest conditions such as:  temperatures of 1,000 °C  polar to tropical operations  high impact vibrations  shock  blasts  extreme water depth  Advanced materials are vital to keeping the UK safe – ranging from body armour for our personnel, to the protection of sensitive electronics in satellites from radiation damage and corrosion-resistant submarine components.  The Henry Royce Institute for advanced materials, which operates its hub at the University of Manchester, will lead the centre of excellence with 23 other partners from academia, industry, and research organisations such as the Catapult Network.  The Henry Royce Institute in Manchester. Credit: Henry Royce Institute  Defence Minister James Cartlidge said:  These exciting new materials not only fortify the safety of our personnel and assets, but also symbolise our creativity and innovation in the face of defence challenges. The research and creation of these materials will secure highly skilled jobs and expertise across the country and cements the UK ’s place as a global leader in advanced materials.  Dstl Chief Executive Dr Paul Hollinshead OBE MBA said:  Advanced materials are the building blocks of the future and an area of great international competition. Today we are putting the UK on path to maintain its strategic advantage by harnessing all the nation’s talents. This highly-collaborative partnership between Dstl , academia and industry will create operational advantage for our armed forces, while supporting UK growth and prosperity.  Defence research not only contributes directly to the prosperity of the UK but it also has a strong track record in developing innovations that have dual-use for the benefit of civilian applications. Funding in the Centre will also help the UK grow the vital skills needed in this important technology area.  A study commissioned by the UK Government showed advanced materials related activity contributes an estimated £14.4 billion in gross value added to the UK economy, equivalent to around £72,000 per employee.  The Centre is set to open later this year.  Centre Associate Director Laura Jones said:  This is a major milestone for Dstl and wider defence to explore and accelerate advanced materials innovation in the UK to help us stay ahead of future threats and challenges.  Dstl and Centre of Excellence Principal Scientist Matthew Lunt said:  Advanced materials are critical in so many areas and we are delighted to bring so much talent together to ensure we can create, sustain and develop these highly-specialised and skilled jobs for years to come.  Regius Professor Phil Withers FRENg FRS , Chief Scientist at the Henry Royce Institute and Regius Professor at the University of Manchester, said:  I am very excited about this opportunity for the Royce to team up with Catapults, industry, other universities and Dstl to bring many of the brightest minds and state of the art capabilities together to undertake materials research and development in support of the UK .

Credit: Henry Royce Institute  Dstl has pioneered numerous advances in materials working with industry and academic partners. A recent example being revolutionising the production of titanium by reducing the 40 stage process down to just 2 stages with a resulting halving in costs.  Titanium alloys offer the potential for transforming defence equipment as they have a similar strength to steel but with approximately half the weight. However, the current cost of titanium is prohibitively expensive for non-aerospace defence uses.  This emerging technological breakthrough is driving the possibility of affordable lightweight, robust, corrosion-resistant components for defence.  Dstl is now working with Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land, the University of Sheffield, BAE Systems, MBDA, Transition International and the Advanced Forming Research Centre on creating more affordable titanium for defence with 30 to 40% weight reduction while maintaining survivability.","New advanced materials centre of excellence - GOV.UK Skip to main content Cookies on GOV.UK We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) projects the population will increase by 6.6 million people (9.9%) between 2021 and 2036. This includes a net migration of 6.1 million people and about 500,000 more births than deaths. The figures say there could be an additional one million people aged 85 and over in the UK by 2036. A Number 10 spokesman said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak thought legal migration had been too high and that it ""must come down quickly."" The projected population growth to about 73.7 million, from the latest estimate of 67 million, is faster than the previous calculation and comes after net migration to the UK hit a record 745,000 in 2022 . The figures suggest the UK population could hit 70 million by the middle of 2026 - a decade sooner than projections published in 2022. During the period between mid-2021 and mid-2036, the ONS's projections suggest: 10.8 million people will be born 10.3 million people will die 13.7 million people will immigrate long term to the UK 7.6 million people will emigrate long term from the UK ONS projections are used to calculate the likely demand for housing and public services. Statisticians are now working on the assumption that from 2028 net migration will contribute 315,000 extra people to the UK per year, an increase greater than the population of Doncaster. Home Secretary James Cleverly has announced that planned restrictions on foreign care workers bringing dependants to the UK will come into force on 11 March. Additionally, the minimum salary required for those arriving on skilled worker visas will rise from £26,200 to £38,700 on 4 April. Mr Cleverly said: ""I've been clear that migration is too high and we must get back to sustainable levels. ""Last year I set out robust measures to reduce the numbers coming into our country, tightening the rules on care workers, skilled workers and making sure that people can support their family members that they bring over."" Tom Pursglove, minister for legal migration, said the measures would make a ""tangible difference"" and showed the government was ""already acting in response to these sorts of figures"". But Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said the latest figures reflected ""14 years of Conservative failure on the economy and immigration"". ""Labour would reform the points-based immigration system to boost training and better link it to the needs of the economy,"" he added. Calls for a cap The projections also put renewed pressure on Mr Sunak from Tory critics, with Downing Street resisting calls from former home secretary Suella Braverman for a cap on legal migration numbers. Robert Jenrick, who quit as immigration minister over the Rwanda policy, said the projected population growth would ""deepen the housing crisis"". James Robards, the head of population at the ONS, said: ""Our projections, which use assumptions based on current and past trends, are not predictions. ""If migration comes down, then so will our assumptions for use in future projections."" The ONS's projections also show an increasing number of older people in the UK. By 2036, the size of the UK population aged 85 years and over is projected to increase from 1.6 million (2.5% of the total population) to 2.6 million (3.5%).

6,https://news.sky.com/story/mobile-phone-broadband-price-hikes-april-bt-ee-vodafone-three-money-blog-latest-13040934,"By Brad Young, Money team  Fears have been raised that new checks on EU goods coming to the UK could result in shortages, price hikes and shrinkflation.  The post-Brexit policy, known as the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), will require documentation for many food, animal and plant products, such as eggs, meat, dairy and alcohol. It comes into play from tomorrow.  EU exporters are likely to pass the costs of the new processes on to consumers in the UK - or even pull out of the market altogether, experts and trade associations have warned.  ""The fundamental change is huge to the nation's food supply,"" Nigel Jenney, chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC), told the Money blog.  ""I would certainly expect to see price rises because these costs simply couldn't be absorbed by the industry.""  Despite leaving the single market three years ago, the UK has repeatedly delayed imposing checks on EU imports.  But under the new rules, many EU exporters will have to submit evidence their products do not pose a risk to livestock, the environment or people's health. Then physical checks will be introduced on 30 April, and further safety declarations are required from 31 October.  ""There's the risk of price increases, because of the additional costs for traders in the EU; there is the potential for increased shrinkflation... and the third [risk] is scarcity,"" said Marc Forgione, director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade (IEIT).  ""There is also a concern that has been raised with me by some UK-based businesses that their suppliers in the EU will frankly take a view that it's too complicated to deal with these changes and withdraw from the market.""  He told the Money blog that over time the UK will have ""the most efficient border in the world"", due to digitisation and the BTOM's assessment of goods based on risk, but it will create friction for EU businesses where there was none.  A 'break' in the supply chain  The horticultural industry will be the ""biggest single users"" of new border control posts, according to James Barnes, chairman of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), because all plants for planting are deemed high-risk.    ""We are deeply concerned that the timing and implementation will cause major issues for our sector,"" he said.  The new processes will add £20m in costs to the sector if they run as planned, but Mr Barnes doubted systems will be in place to handle physical checks efficiently before April - just as the industry's peak trading season begins.  Any delays will lead to shortages, while extra costs from breaking up the supply chain are ""clearly potentially inflationary"", he said.  'Clarity is absolutely non-existent'  Potentially adding to those costs is uncertainty among businesses over what is expected of them.  One area of confusion raised by HTA, FPC and IEIT was how a single truck carrying goods from dozens of suppliers would be checked without increasing delays - which was particularly important for temperature-controlled goods or those with short shelf lives.  ""Clarity is absolutely non-existent... we have been in dialogue with government for years now asking for information and our members are still struggling,"" Mr Jenney said.  ""There are a constant range of questions that are simply not being answered.""  Mr Forgione said uncertainty could lead to inadvertent rule breaches, and in turn denial of entry, congestion and delays in getting products on shelves.  'Disquiet' among small businesses  It was also unclear how the government would enforce the new rules in April, said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce.  He said this was one of several ""pinch points"", another being that the new border posts will be paid for in part by an unknown flat rate usage charge to businesses, causing ""disquiet"" among smaller ones by hitting them hardest.  Problems may also be caused by discrepancies between the request for safety certification by the UK government, and the various health authorities across EU nations fulfilling it because they have different definitions of risk and procedures for evaluating it, Mr Bain explained.  The government said: ""We remain committed to delivering the most advanced border in the world.  ""The changes we're bringing in will help keep the UK safe, while protecting our food supply chains and our agricultural sector from disease outbreaks that would cause significant economic harm.""    The spokesman added: ""We have and will continue to work with industry, ports and airports to prepare for the changes being implemented.""

Analysis by Adam Parsons , Europe correspondent The blockades that are being set up around Paris speak of two things - the anger of farmers and also of their determination to see this protest through to its conclusion. Their grievances are long-standing, based on the premise that politicians in Paris and Brussels simply don't understand the problems facing farmers in the rest of the country. And at the heart of it is money. Grain farmer Geraldine Grillon, 46, in Longvilliers, near Paris, in front of a banner that reads 'Macron, answer us' Reuters Farmers - in France and beyond - maintain that their incomes are falling to such an extent that their jobs are barely sustainable. Partly this is down to the rising costs they face - the price of fertiliser has increased hugely, for instance, since the start of the war in Ukraine, while imports of Ukrainian grain into Europe have forced down the price of that produce. In fact, the impact of cheaper imports is another complaint that you hear at these protests. If cheap lamb is coming in from abroad, for instance, that inevitably reduces the price that a domestic farmer can achieve. For this, they blame free trade agreements that, they say, benefit foreign farmers at their cost. Another frequent complaint is that a huge growth in the regulations governing farming, notably environmental rules, have forced them to spend valuable time in the office when they should be out in the fields. ""It used to be a few hours a month and now it's one day per week,"" according to one farmer. French farmers block a highway in Longvilliers Reuters Tax breaks, such as one that cut the price farmers paid for diesel, have been reversed. And all the while, farmers believe the government has ignored them; that their role in feeding the nation has been forgotten. These protests aren't confined to France. Germany has seen enormous demonstrations, with tractors pouring into some of the nation's biggest cities. Farmers had already taken to the roads in Poland and Romania and now there are fresh protests springing up daily - in Belgium, Italy, Spain and elsewhere. This is a European movement, even if much of the focus is trained upon France. And the targets of anger are usually the same - national governments who are seen as failing to support their farmers, and the European Union, which is blamed for imposing burdensome regulations. Farmers say there is a contradiction between the EU's desire to be self-sufficient with its food and the red tape imposed upon its agricultural sector. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, architect of the EU ""Green Deal"" that is often cited as the problem, has few friends among the protesting farmers. Somewhere, at national and EU levels, there will have to be an effort at reconciliation. For the moment, at least, the anger is simmering; it won't take much for it to boil.

Sky News has obtained the draft of a letter from the Investment Association, whose members collectively manage £8.8trn in assets, to the chairs of FTSE 350 remuneration committees in which it signals a significant change in its stance towards bosses' pay. In the letter, which is expected to be released publicly within days, the IA says it intends to conduct a ""fundamental review of the Principles of Remuneration [later this year]…reflecting the evolving member expectations on remuneration and feedback from companies"". The IA said it acknowledged feedback from companies - particularly the largest in the FTSE 100 - that they were finding it increasingly challenging to ""attract US executives and compete in the US market"" because of the gulf between pay deals for bosses working for London and New York-listed businesses.

Rishi Sunak decided to charge tourists VAT on their shopping in 2021 - which is now being partially blamed for the UK's slow recovery in tourism. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said visitor numbers to the UK would have been 589,000 higher during the third quarter of last year if a tax rebate scheme had been in place, leading to £1.3bn more spending. Over the year, it said visitor numbers could have been boosted by two million with a £4bn rise in spending - resulting in a £11.1bn increase in GDP and £2.5bn net fiscal gain. Uber couriers will be used to start delivering prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines across the UK. Patients will be able to arrange delivery through the Healthera app and will often receive their products within an hour. They will also be able to track their delivery in real time. The number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers hit a six-month high in December, according to Bank of England figures. Some 50,459 mortgages were approved for house purchase. The ""effective"" interest rate - the actual interest paid - on newly drawn mortgages fell from 5.34% in November to 5.28% in December, the first drop since November 2021. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""We can celebrate approvals pushing through 50,000, and there are some signs that January has seen another bounce, but we're still a long way from a healthy market.""

In what will be seen as a bombshell intervention ahead of this year's election, the Fund, widely regarded as the world's most authoritative economic body, said its analysts had advised the UK Treasury not to cut taxes. And, in a further blow to the chancellor , it expressed scepticism about his spending plans for the coming years, raising questions about his ability to meet his own fiscal rules. The comments, issued alongside the Fund's latest update to its economic forecasts, comes after the chancellor signalled that he plans to cut taxes in March's spring budget . An IMF spokesman said: ""As noted in the 2023 Article IV consultation, preserving high-quality public services, and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government's budget plans. ""Accommodating these needs… will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side. ""The IMF has recommended strengthening carbon and property taxation, eliminating loopholes in wealth and income taxation, and reforming the pensions triple lock. ""It is in this context that staff advises against further tax cuts."" The comments came as the Fund cut its forecast for UK growth next year, from 2% to 1.6%. However, the UK is no longer forecast to be the slowest growing economy among the Group of Seven industrialised nations , after the Fund cut its outlook for Germany this year to 0.5% - below Britain's (unchanged) 0.6% forecast.

Yesterday we reported on criticism from customers about the small number of stores stocking the product and the retailer's limited online ordering capabilities. The high-street giant launched the range, made for people with disabilities, this month. Social media influencer Amy Pohl said she was ""so excited"" about the collection, but it made ""zero sense"" to only make it accessible to people in a ""limited area of the country"". Posting a TikTok video, she said she went to her local Primark to hunt down the products and travelled for an hour to a larger shop in Newcastle but couldn't find them in either store. ""With Primark there is no option to shop online either, so it's just totally inaccessible,"" she said. ""Why advertise something when it's not in all your stores yet."" Primark had said the line was available to purchase in 12 of its 191 stores across the UK, and could be ordered via click and collect to 57 shops. Today the store apologised, telling Sky News: ""We're really sorry that some people haven't been able to access our new adaptive lingerie collection. ""The new range was launched alongside a wider commitment to drive change across our business and stores to better serve disabled colleagues and customers, and to make more adaptive products and apply inclusive design to more of our product ranges. ""When we introduce any new range we will often launch in selected stores to help us understand the customer demand and response to the product range. ""This is a new type of product for us and we want to ensure that the inclusive design features that we are applying are what our customers are looking for. These learnings will help us to understand how we will scale our offering in the future and we hope to be able to offer more adaptive products in more of our stores in the future."" Copy link Close post 10h ago 18:06 What is marriage allowance - and how can you get it? Basically, the Married Couple's Allowance could reduce your tax bill each year if you're married or in a civil partnership. The amount it could save you is £252. Firstly, some jargon we're going to mention a few times... Your personal tax allowance is the amount you can earn tax-free each tax year; For most people the personal allowance is £12,570 - this is the basic income tax threshold ; Basic rate taxpayers earn less than £50,270, or £43,662 in Scotland. With these definitions in mind, marriage allowance works by allowing a partner earning less than the basic income tax threshold of £12,570 to transfer some of their personal tax allowance to their higher earning partner - as long as they're a basic-rate taxpayer earning less than £50,270. You can transfer up to £1,260 of your personal tax allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner to cut their tax bill. A simple example... Your income is £8,500, so you do not pay income tax. Your partner's income is £20,000. You both have the standard tax allowance of £12,570. This means your partner pays tax on £7,430. After claiming marriage allowance, £1,260 of your personal tax allowance is transferred to your partner. That brings their personal tax allowance to £13,830 - meaning they only pay the 20% income tax on £6,170. This saves them £252. It's worth noting that if you earn less than £12,570, but more than £11,310 (the personal allowance minus the transferrable £1,260), you may end up paying some tax if you transfer your allowance - but you'll still save money as a couple. If you fall within this bracket, it's worth doing more research. What if I've only just learnt I can get it? If you've been eligible for marriage allowance for a while but have only just realised you can claim it, don't worry. You can backdate your claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2019. Your partner's tax bill will be lowered depending on their personal tax allowance rate for the years you're backdating. You can still claim the allowance if your partner has died since then. How do I apply? You can apply for marriage allowance on the government website . Make sure you have a Government Gateway account before you go to make your claim.

George Freeman, who resigned as science minister in November during a cabinet reshuffle, would have been on an annual salary of about £118,300. He held a number of ministerial posts in successive Conservative governments and pocketed severance payments after departing.

The newspaper says officials in Michael Gove's Levelling Up Department have told local authority bosses they expect the maximum possible 4.99% increase to be applied to council tax in April. This compares with inflation, which stands at 4%. About £100 could be added to a typical band D council tax bill. The reported increases come despite promises from Rishi Sunak to deliver pre-election giveaways. David Phillips, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Guardian that increasing council tax while cutting most direct taxes would be ""regressive"". Last week, Housing Secretary Michael Gove announced a boost of £600m for local government funding in England. Housing minister Lee Rowley was asked by Sky News about the Guardian report this morning, and said: ""It's ultimately for councils to decide how they want to raise tax. Some raise it to a particular level or to a lesser level. ""It's ultimately for individual councillors, elected to support their communities, to decide how they want to spend that money and what they do with council tax.""

The post-Brexit policy, known as the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), will require documentation for many food, animal and plant products, such as eggs, meat, dairy and alcohol. It comes into play from tomorrow. EU exporters are likely to pass the costs of the new processes on to consumers in the UK -  or even pull out of the market altogether, experts and trade associations have warned. ""The fundamental change is huge to the nation's food supply,"" Nigel Jenney, chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC), told the Money blog. ""I would certainly expect to see price rises because these costs simply couldn't be absorbed by the industry."" iStock Despite leaving the single market three years ago, the UK has repeatedly delayed imposing checks on EU imports. But under the new rules, many EU exporters will have to submit evidence their products do not pose a risk to livestock, the environment or people's health. Then physical checks will be introduced on 30 April, and further safety declarations are required from 31 October. ""There's the risk of price increases, because of the additional costs for traders in the EU; there is the potential for increased shrinkflation... and the third [risk] is scarcity,"" said Marc Forgione, director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade (IEIT). ""There is also a concern that has been raised with me by some UK-based businesses that their suppliers in the EU will frankly take a view that it's too complicated to deal with these changes and withdraw from the market."" He told the Money blog that over time the UK will have ""the most efficient border in the world"", due to digitisation and the BTOM's assessment of goods based on risk, but it will create friction for EU businesses where there was none. Queues in Dover after the EU's introduction of border checks after Brexit in 2021 PA A 'break' in the supply chain The horticultural industry will be the ""biggest single users"" of new border control posts, according to James Barnes, chairman of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), because all plants for planting are deemed high-risk. ""We are deeply concerned that the timing and implementation will cause major issues for our sector,"" he said. The new processes will add £20m in costs to the sector if they run as planned, but Mr Barnes doubted systems will be in place to handle physical checks efficiently before April - just as the industry's peak trading season begins. Any delays will lead to shortages, while extra costs from breaking up the supply chain are ""clearly potentially inflationary"", he said. 'Clarity is absolutely non-existent' Potentially adding to those costs is uncertainty among businesses over what is expected of them. One area of confusion raised by HTA, FPC and IEIT was how a single truck carrying goods from dozens of suppliers would be checked without increasing delays - which was particularly important for temperature-controlled goods or those with short shelf lives. ""Clarity is absolutely non-existent... we have been in dialogue with government for years now asking for information and our members are still struggling,"" Mr Jenney said. ""There are a constant range of questions that are simply not being answered."" Mr Forgione said uncertainty could lead to inadvertent rule breaches, and in turn denial of entry, congestion and delays in getting products on shelves. 'Disquiet' among small businesses It was also unclear how the government would enforce the new rules in April, said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce. He said this was one of several ""pinch points"", another being that the new border posts will be paid for in part by an unknown flat rate usage charge to businesses, causing ""disquiet"" among smaller ones by hitting them hardest. Problems may also be caused by discrepancies between the request for safety certification by the UK government, and the various health authorities across EU nations fulfilling it because they have different definitions of risk and procedures for evaluating it, Mr Bain explained. The government said: ""We remain committed to delivering the most advanced border in the world. ""The changes we're bringing in will help keep the UK safe, while protecting our food supply chains and our agricultural sector from disease outbreaks that would cause significant economic harm."" The spokesman added: ""We have and will continue to work with industry, ports and airports to prepare for the changes being implemented.""

Over previous months, prices had been falling more sharply - but the latest figure represents a drop of just 0.1% on December as shops reined in Christmas offers. Kantar said Britons were continuing to trim costs while inflation remains ""stubbornly high""... Shoppers are turning to packed lunches in an attempt to try and keep their budgets in line, with 86 million more lunchboxes brought to work last year, the research suggests; Spending on alcohol fell by more than half in January compared with December - with people taking part in Dry January and other health challenges; In addition, researchers said ""Veganuary"" could be responsible for an 8% increase in sales of own label plant-based ranges. Separate figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) - a trade association which represents supermarkets - and NielsenIQ, also out on Tuesday, were more upbeat. Their research suggests shop price inflation - which includes both groceries and non-food items like clothes - fell this month to its lowest level since May 2022. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said the drop was driven mostly by offers on non-food items. However, a drop in the price of tea and milk was also said to be a factor.

It was said HSBC failed ""over many years"" to properly put in place the requirements to protect customer deposits dating back to 2015.

As the Money team has reported throughout the month, telecoms firms are set to implement inflation-linked April price rises. Most big providers include in their contracts increases of 3.9% plus December's inflation rate each year, which crept up to 4% in 2023. Consumer group Which? has found these price hikes can be equivalent to paying for almost an extra month of service. ""It's outrageous that telecoms firms could yet again trap their customers between inflation-busting price hikes and punitive exit fees this April, despite Ofcom declaring this practice causes substantial consumer harm,"" Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said. PA Many firms imposed price increases of more than 14% last year, given the high rate of inflation. Which? wants providers to cancel the hikes. BT, EE and Plusnet have confirmed they will be going ahead with 7.9% broadband cost increases in April, Which? reported. That's £35.92 extra for the average BT user a year - or a £218.64 exit fee (for those with 12 months remaining on their contract), according to Which?. Vodafone SIM-only mobile customers face the same percentage change, resulting in the average customer paying £27.36 more a year or shelling out £339.75 to exit the contract early. EE mobile customers face a £24.84 hike or a £289.64 exit fee, while Three mobile customers face a £19.20 hike or a £235.24 exit fee. Copy link Close post 16h ago 11:43 24 leading universities criticise plan for real-terms cut to student maintenance loans A group representing 24 leading UK universities has criticised government plans to increase maintenance loans for university students by just 2.5% this year, saying it will hit disadvantaged students hardest. The Russel Group said those studying in England will be £2,000 worse off than if the government had increased loans in line with inflation since 2021-22. Students receiving maintenance loans have seen a real-terms cut in recent years - and will again this year iStock A quarter of students already regularly go without food and other necessities due to financial hardship, said Joanna Burton, head of policy for Higher Education. ""Once again, we are disappointed to see that there has been no move to correct the maintenance loan shortfall suffered by students in recent years,"" she said. Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis echoed her comments, pointing out that with inflation still at 4%, government proposals amount to a real-terms cut in funding. ""That is, in my view, a threat to social mobility,"" he posted on X. Martin Lewis says social mobility is under threat PA Had maximum maintenance loans increased with inflation, students would have been able to apply for £12,130, according to Russel Group analysis, but they will only be offered £10,227. Since 2008, the maximum maintenance loan has only been available to people whose parents earn less than £25,000, but the value of that income level has changed drastically in that time period. Had this threshold increased with earnings, it would now be closer to £35,000, according to the Russel Group. Announcing the decision last week, higher education minister Robert Halfon said: ""We have continued to increase maximum loans and grants for living costs each year with the most support for students from the lowest income families. ""Decisions on student finance have had to be taken to ensure the system remains financially sustainable and the costs of higher education are shared fairly between students and taxpayers, not all of whom have benefited from going to university."" Copy link Close post 30 Jan 00:00 Bank could hike interest rate to warn 'over-excited' lenders The Bank of England could raise rates this week to warn mortgage lenders they've become ""over-excited"" about the speed inflation is coming down, according to an investment analyst. Even if the Bank holds rates at 5.25% on Thursday, as is widely expected, its Monetary Policy Committee may not be unanimous in that decision, which could push up market interest rates, said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell. With the Consumer Price Index having crept up to 4% in December, a further rise would reduce the spending power Jeremy Hunt has in his March budget. ""It feels like the market may have got over-excited about looser monetary policy in the UK,"" Mr Khalaf said. ""If the Bank wants to send a signal that markets have got ahead of themselves, this week's interest rate decision provides a golden opportunity to do so."" Mr Khalaf explained freezing the rate would not itself move interest rates, but the market may be sensitive to the challenge the decision posed to its assumptions about how many rate cuts are expected this year. Right now, markets anticipate there will be four Bank rate cuts starting in May or June, Mr Khalaf said. ""The market is convinced the Bank will sit on its hands at the forthcoming meeting, but the rhetoric around the decision, the economic forecasts produced, or the split of the committee vote may well move interest rate markets."" If interest rates do rise on the back of Thursday's meeting, that will increase the cost of government borrowing, leaving the chancellor less wiggle room in March.

It would end an almost two-year power vacuum in the region after the Democratic Unionist party collapsed the Stormont government to protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements.  We have heard this before. What is different this time?  A new deal that centres on concessions made by London, not Brussels, was put to DUP executive members and debated over five hours, with an announcement in the small hours of Tuesday morning that the party had endorsed the agreement brokered by its leader, Jeffrey Donaldson.  Donaldson told BBC radio on Tuesday that the deal – details of which the UK government will publish on Wednesday – would include “constitutional legislation” as well as practical arrangements. “The result was clear. The DUP has been decisive. I have been mandated to move forward,” Donaldson said.  What about the Windsor framework?  Agreement comes 11 months after Brussels made major concessions in replacing the original Northern Ireland protocol Brexit trading arrangements with the Windsor framework, in a deal sweetened by No 10, memorably, by a meeting between European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and King Charles.  That deal was hailed by Rishi Sunak and Von der Leyen as the breakthrough that would end the DUP’s boycott of Stormont.  So why didn’t the DUP return to Stormont in February 2023?  The DUP had argued that, even with the concessions by Brussels, the Windsor framework undermined Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, forcing traders to deal differently with the region.  How soon could Stormont resume?  Sinn Féin’s Conor Murphy has said he believes the executive could be back up and running “before the week is out”.  Pressure from the public has been mounting in recent weeks with an estimated 150,000 public sector workers in Northern Ireland on strike two weeks ago, the largest protest in more than 50 years. They had not received pay increases despite high inflation following the collapse of the power-sharing government.  Northern Ireland’s health service is routinely ranked as the worst in the UK with long waiting lists and poor health outcomes. The government made a £3.3bn financial package – that included pay rises for public sector workers – conditional on Stormont’s revival.  What is in the deal?  Donaldson said it would end “dynamic alignment” whereby future changes in EU law would have to be observed in Northern Ireland.  Pending the deal’s publication on Wednesday, it appears that Sunak has offered to keep Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) aligned with European standards if the DUP returned to Stormont.  All new laws at Westminster would be checked to ensure they did not compromise unfettered trade with Northern Ireland, meaning no separate rules or labels for goods that remain in the region.  Does that mean the UK will remain closer to Brussels?  It appears that the deal is a dusting down of proposals Theresa May made in 2019 to align rules for Ireland with those in the UK, thereby removing the need for what because known as the Brexit sea border.  This compromise was rejected by the Conservatives, whose policies were then shaped by convulsions about sovereignty, taking back control of British law and a clean break Brexit.  Will the hard Brexiters be able to kill the deal?  Liz Truss, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith opposed the Windsor framework last March, arguing that the Stormont brake, the mechanism by which the Belfast executive could block new EU laws applying locally, was not substantial enough.  How can Sunak sell this?  He can argue that the alignment with EU law is limited and applies to goods and farm produce and not wider issues such as the rule of law and other national competencies such as health, education, security, justice.  What will this mean for a potential Labour government?  It could make it easier for Keir Starmer to strike a veterinary agreement with the EU, which would dynamically align foods standards with EU standards, paving the way for fewer trade barriers between the UK and the EU as a whole.","Northern Ireland: what is the power-sharing deal – and could it be blocked? | Northern Ireland | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland 00:02:02 Protests at Stormont as DUP agrees deal to restore Northern Ireland power sharing – video report Northern Ireland Explainer Northern Ireland: what is the power-sharing deal – and could it be blocked?

3,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/30/devon-village-mourns-loss-oak-tree-fell-silverton,"Since the 15th century, perhaps even longer, Broad Oak has been part of the Silverton landscape. Residents of the Devon village, one of the oldest in the south-west of England, have met beneath the tree’s mighty boughs clambered into the canopy, taken a few moments of peace in its shade. Theatre companies have borrowed it for a backdrop; people in need of comfort have hugged it; the primary school uses its image as its badge.  Now young and old are mourning its loss after the great tree fell – on a calm, sunny day rather than a stormy one – and the village is working out what to do with the remains of the oak, now crumpled across the recreation ground.  So many spoke of a feeling of bereavement. “It has been part of villagers’ childhoods, a part of the village scenery, a landmark meeting place for kids,” said Adrian Ryder. “But mostly just an awesome natural beauty that was living and breathing for so long in the village. It is such a shame that after circa 700 years it laid itself to rest – the stories it could tell.”  David Wright, who saw the tree fall at 12.30pm on 25 January, said: “I was sitting with a coffee looking out of the window when movement caught my eye. The oak tree was slowly tipping over. It seemed so slow it was surreal. Our first thought was to run to the tree to make sure there was nobody hurt, calling out then looking under the remains to see if anyone was visible. Thankfully only fences, paths and turf was destroyed.”  It could have been an even sadder story if Jan Ross, who lives closest to the tree, had not decided to pop down to the village shop for a copy of her newspaper (the Guardian, as it happens) on the day it fell.  View image in fullscreen Arboriculturists are keen to work on the remains to help with dating of the tree. Photograph: Warren Radmore/Aerial Dimensions  “As I emerged from the store, I received a phone call from a neighbour telling me the oak had come down,” said Ross. “One of the large limbs of the tree crashed along the end of my garden demolishing the sturdy wooden fence. Ten minutes before the tree came down I was doing some garden tidying next to the fence and checking on the progress of spring bulbs. I could have been under its boughs.”  She added: “I have been a daily reader for over 50 years and it may have saved my life. We are all sad but even 700- to 800-year-old trees do come to the end of their life and we must make good use of what they leave us.”  It was standing-room only at the community hall on Monday evening as more than 50 residents gathered to try to decide what to do now. They were told workers with a crane would be on site in the coming days to make the tree safe.  View image in fullscreen The Broad Oak was a popular feature in Silverton. Photograph: Adrian Ryder  The villagers heard that arboriculturists were keen to work on the remains to help with dating of the tree and to examine how it had been affected by the climate emergency. There was talk of how best to maximise the chances of hanging on to some of the precious, complex ecosystems that such a tree held.  People wanted to make sure some solid commemoration remained for future inhabitants. Slices of the trunk may be put on display. Some wanted a big branch left for children to play on and asked if larger pieces of the wood could be turned into public furniture and smaller ones into coasters or beer mats.  There was also enthusiasm for more tree planting in the community and a commitment to support wildlife and the environment with perhaps an annual tree planting on the anniversary of the fall. The hopeful wondered if a new tree could grow from the remains and a map of trees grown from Broad Oak’s acorns is being mooted.  View image in fullscreen Broad Oak contained various types of fungi. Photograph: Nikki Shaw  Nikki Shaw shared pictures of the tree that could give clues as to why it came down and illustrated its rich biodiversity. One shows a sheared limb that fell in the opposite direction to the trunk, and appears to be rotten.  “It may have unbalanced the tree,” she said. Another was of five types of fungi on one branch, including oak crust and witches’ butter. A third was of a knopper gall that forms around acorns after a tiny wasp inoculates embryonic acorn buds with her eggs. “It is possibly the reason we have so few of its offspring around. Acorns have been hard to find some years since the 80s.”  It is not just current residents who are dealing with the loss. James Carroll, who previously lived in the village, said: “There are a good few former residents I have been in touch with around the country who are equally upset. Some were in tears. For many it’s like a family bereavement. For many of us who grew up in Silverton its was a part of our childhood and a sign of stability and permanence.”  Anthony Richards, the director of the professional theatre company Common Players, said the group had toured three versions of Robin Hood to the oak tree in the past 30 years. “The last, in 2001, was called The Tuck Inn and involved a community feast. Our cast have been mourning its passing. It was quite an inspiration to us.”  A poetic tribute from Olivia Kennard, who lives locally, was posted on the village’s Facebook page: “That wonderful tree was gentle to the last, just lying down quietly with the minimum of fuss and damage. I salute you.”","‘It’s like a family bereavement’: Devon village mourns loss of beloved oak tree | Devon | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 3 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland 00:00:47 Aerial footage shows fallen 700-year-old Devon oak tree – video Devon ‘It’s like a family bereavement’: Devon village mourns loss of beloved oak tree On a calm, sunny day, Silverton’s Broad Oak fell after standing for hundreds of years, leaving many grappling with grief Steven Morris @stevenmorris20 Tue 30 Jan 2024 12.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 30 Jan 2024 21.36 GMT S ince the 15th century, perhaps even longer, Broad Oak has been part of the Silverton landscape.

So many spoke of a feeling of bereavement. “It has been part of villagers’ childhoods, a part of the village scenery, a landmark meeting place for kids,” said Adrian Ryder. “But mostly just an awesome natural beauty that was living and breathing for so long in the village. It is such a shame that after circa 700 years it laid itself to rest – the stories it could tell.” David Wright, who saw the tree fall at 12.30pm on 25 January, said: “I was sitting with a coffee looking out of the window when movement caught my eye. The oak tree was slowly tipping over. It seemed so slow it was surreal. Our first thought was to run to the tree to make sure there was nobody hurt, calling out then looking under the remains to see if anyone was visible. Thankfully only fences, paths and turf was destroyed.” It could have been an even sadder story if Jan Ross, who lives closest to the tree, had not decided to pop down to the village shop for a copy of her newspaper (the Guardian, as it happens) on the day it fell.

Photograph: Warren Radmore/Aerial Dimensions “As I emerged from the store, I received a phone call from a neighbour telling me the oak had come down,” said Ross. “One of the large limbs of the tree crashed along the end of my garden demolishing the sturdy wooden fence. Ten minutes before the tree came down I was doing some garden tidying next to the fence and checking on the progress of spring bulbs. I could have been under its boughs.” She added: “I have been a daily reader for over 50 years and it may have saved my life. We are all sad but even 700- to 800-year-old trees do come to the end of their life and we must make good use of what they leave us.” It was standing-room only at the community hall on Monday evening as more than 50 residents gathered to try to decide what to do now. They were told workers with a crane would be on site in the coming days to make the tree safe. View image in fullscreen The Broad Oak was a popular feature in Silverton. Photograph: Adrian Ryder The villagers heard that arboriculturists were keen to work on the remains to help with dating of the tree and to examine how it had been affected by the climate emergency. There was talk of how best to maximise the chances of hanging on to some of the precious, complex ecosystems that such a tree held. People wanted to make sure some solid commemoration remained for future inhabitants. Slices of the trunk may be put on display. Some wanted a big branch left for children to play on and asked if larger pieces of the wood could be turned into public furniture and smaller ones into coasters or beer mats. There was also enthusiasm for more tree planting in the community and a commitment to support wildlife and the environment with perhaps an annual tree planting on the anniversary of the fall. The hopeful wondered if a new tree could grow from the remains and a map of trees grown from Broad Oak’s acorns is being mooted. View image in fullscreen Broad Oak contained various types of fungi. Photograph: Nikki Shaw Nikki Shaw shared pictures of the tree that could give clues as to why it came down and illustrated its rich biodiversity. One shows a sheared limb that fell in the opposite direction to the trunk, and appears to be rotten. “It may have unbalanced the tree,” she said. Another was of five types of fungi on one branch, including oak crust and witches’ butter. A third was of a knopper gall that forms around acorns after a tiny wasp inoculates embryonic acorn buds with her eggs. “It is possibly the reason we have so few of its offspring around. Acorns have been hard to find some years since the 80s.” It is not just current residents who are dealing with the loss. James Carroll, who previously lived in the village, said: “There are a good few former residents I have been in touch with around the country who are equally upset. Some were in tears. For many it’s like a family bereavement. For many of us who grew up in Silverton its was a part of our childhood and a sign of stability and permanence.” Anthony Richards, the director of the professional theatre company Common Players, said the group had toured three versions of Robin Hood to the oak tree in the past 30 years. “The last, in 2001, was called The Tuck Inn and involved a community feast. Our cast have been mourning its passing. It was quite an inspiration to us.” A poetic tribute from Olivia Kennard, who lives locally, was posted on the village’s Facebook page: “That wonderful tree was gentle to the last, just lying down quietly with the minimum of fuss and damage. I salute you.” Explore more on these topics Devon Trees and forests Heritage Conservation England features Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The bank failed to accurately identify deposits eligible for Britain's Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said. Under the scheme, customer deposits are protected up to the value of £85,000. HSBC said it was pleased to have resolved the ""historic matter"". The fine is the second highest to date imposed by the regulator, reflecting the seriousness of the failings, the PRA said. The regulator said the problems occurred between 2015 and 2022. Under depositor protection rules, banks must have systems and controls in place to make sure that financial information is logged correctly. This information is needed if the FSCS has to make payments to customers if a bank collapses. One of HSBC's subsidiaries - HSBC Bank - was found to have incorrectly marked 99% of its eligible beneficiary deposits as ""ineligible"" for FSCS protection. HSBC Bank also provided incorrect evidence that its systems satisfied certain requirements of the deposit protection rules, the PRA said. The PRA said the failings were ""so significant"" that ""it had materially undermined the firm's readiness"" for any restructuring should it have been required. It also said that the bank had ""failed to be duly open and cooperative with the PRA"" by not alerting it over an approximately 15-month period about the problems identified. PRA chief executive Sam Woods said : ""The serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA's safety and soundness objective. ""It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution,"" he said, adding the lender had fallen ""far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner"". However, the PRA said that it did not consider the bank's breaches to be ""deliberate or reckless"". HSBC fined £64m for anti-money laundering failings The bank's cooperation throughout the investigation, including admitting early on that it had broken rules, resulted in a reduction to the penalty, the regulator said.  Without these reductions, HSBC woudl have been fined £96.5m. HSBC said it would continue to remain focused on serving its customers. ""The PRA's final notice recognises the Bank's co-operation with the investigation, as well as our efforts to fully resolve these issues,"" the bank said. This is the second largest fine the PRA has imposed to date. The highest fine was £87m imposed on Credit Suisse in July 2023. It is not HSBC's first brush with authorities over failings within its banking operations. The lending giant was fined £63.9m by the UK's financial regulator in 2021 for ""unacceptable failings"" of its anti-money laundering systems. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said weaknesses in HSBC's financial crime safeguards had been highlighted several times before action was taken. In 2012, HSBC paid $1.9bn after an investigation by the US Department of Justice, for failing to prevent money laundering by Mexican drug cartels. The bank agreed to be monitored by US regulators for five years. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk .

Officers said the man has since been released on bail while enquiries continue. Rwanda's 100 days of slaughter Published 4 April 2019 Rwanda: How the genocide happened Published 17 May 2011 The War Crimes team is a national unit run within the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police. Commander Dominic Murphy said the investigation follows “allegations of the most serious offences you can imagine” and anyone who perpetrated the atrocity ""should face justice wherever they are in the world"". He added: “Gathering the evidence to support a potential future prosecution is a complex process that requires diligence and precision. ""While an arrest is a significant milestone in any investigation, officers will continue to work to progress this inquiry.” The investigation is not connected to ongoing war crime inquiries which were launched in 2018, looking at five other UK based individuals. Between April and June 1994, it is estimated that 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days.

The Japanese macaque broke free from its enclosure at Highland Wildlife Park near Kingussie on Sunday.

The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which runs the park, has assembled a team to find and capture the missing macaque.  Image: The monkey was spotted in a garden in a nearby village. Pic: Carl Nagle  Keith Gilchrist, living collections operations manager at the wildlife park, said Cairngorms Mountain Rescue had ""kindly offered to support"" the search with their thermal imaging drone.  He also said the search team is responding to a sighting made on Tuesday morning.  ""Throughout the day our expert team of animal keepers will be patrolling the local area using a variety of techniques to try and coax him in, as well as using our thermal image drone contractor to aid with the search,"" he said.  Image: Japanese macaque.

Media caption, John Swinney told the UK Covid inquiry that he manually deleted text messages with the former first minister. By Angus Cochrane BBC Scotland News Scotland's former deputy first minister has told the UK Covid inquiry that he manually deleted messages sent to Nicola Sturgeon during the pandemic. John Swinney said the texts with the ex-first minister were ""not available"". The SNP MSP said they had been removed in line with his understanding of Scottish government records policy. Mr Swinney also denied a suggestion that Scottish cabinet meetings were ""driven"" by Ms Sturgeon's ""strong mindedness"". It came after ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes said she was surprised no minutes were kept from top-level meetings during the Covid crisis. Mr Swinney served as deputy first minister and education secretary until May 2021. Following a reshuffle, he left the latter role to become Covid recovery secretary. He stepped down from government in March 2023. Not closing schools in second lockdown would have been 'reckless' Gove denies government played politics in pandemic Sturgeon called Johnson a 'clown', inquiry hears The inquiry had already heard that none of his WhatsApps or ""similar messages"" had been retained. A document supplied to the inquiry stated the texts had been either deleted manually or by using an auto-delete function. The former deputy first minister told the inquiry he rarely spoke to Ms Sturgeon via text messages or other informal means. He said texts were generally only used to set up a phone call. Mr Swinney told the inquiry that since entering government in 2007 he had ""deleted material after I have made sure any relevant information was placed on the official record of the government, and that was the approach I was advised to take"". He said this approach was never ""questioned"" in previous years in government and was ""consistent"" with the ministerial code. The former deputy first minister conceded that it ""might well be the case"" that all the information needed by the inquiry might not be retained. He said he would apologise ""unreservedly"" if he had ""misunderstood"" the government's records management policy. Image source, PA Media Image caption, Former first minster Nicola Sturgeon is due to give evidence on Wednesday ""My intention was never to do anything other than ensure the official record was furnished with all of the information that it needed to have,"" Mr Swinney said. The inquiry was sent 18 pages of WhatsApp messages between Mr Swinney and current First Minister Humza Yousaf from during the pandemic. They were recovered from an old handset of Mr Yousaf's after Mr Swinney erased his messages, the inquiry heard. ""They would be deleted by periodic deletion once I was satisfied I had told my private office any info that was relevant so that I was not facing a large number of messages that I would potentially have to delete on one occasion,"" Mr Swinney added. Freeman will regret Covid care home deaths 'for rest of my life' Derogatory texts between Yousaf and Leitch released The inquiry was also shown messages from 14 December 2021, following cabinet talks, between then health secretary Mr Yousaf and national clinical director Jason Leitch. At the meeting, Mr Yousaf had suggested unexpectedly that he may be able to make £100m from the health budget available for business support as the government considered another lockdown. In the messages, Mr Yousaf told Mr Leitch that Ms Sturgeon had been ""ranting"" at him and he had taken ""one hell of a bullet"". Mr Leitch said Ms Sturgeon was being ""ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous"" and that he ""almost intervened"". Image source, UK Covid Inquiry Lead counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, put it to Mr Swinney that the culture of the Scottish cabinet was driven by Ms Sturgeon's ""strong mindedness when challenging her was seen as taking a bullet"". Mr Swinney said: ""No, because I think that particular morning, the first minister was a little bit surprised that the health portfolio had been able to find £100m to transfer to business support. ""In all my 10 years of handling the public finances of Scotland, the health secretary never offered me £100m in exchange for anything."" He insisted the cabinet had ""open and full discussions"". Ms Forbes, in messages about the same cabinet meeting, said she had ""never seen the FM this angry in all my cabinets for good reason"". She told the inquiry that while ""surprises"" were not typically welcome at cabinet, Mr Yousaf had tried to be ""helpful"" and had not tried to ""undermine the process"". School closures Mr Swinney told the inquiry that the decision to close schools in March 2020 was made during a conversation between him and Ms Sturgeon, not in a discussion involving the full cabinet. The former deputy first minister said this was because ""events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace"". He added the Scottish government ""did not have the time or the opportunity"" to complete an equality impact assessment on children's learning and development if schools were closed. Earlier, the inquiry heard that the Scottish government's equivalent of Cobra meetings - the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) - had not been minuted. Image source, PA Media Image caption, Former finance secretary Kate Forbes gave evidence to the UK Covid Inquiry Neither were records kept for so-called ""gold command"" meetings - attended by Ms Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and a revolving group of ministers. Ms Forbes confirmed to the inquiry she did not attend any of the ""gold command"" discussions in 2020. Asked by inquiry chairwoman Lady Hallett why she was not invited despite her seniority, Ms Forbes said she was ""not even sure"" they existed at the time. Ms Forbes added: ""I would have expected to be invited to any meeting where there were significant financial implications."" 'Difficult to understand' She said she understood ""frustration"" at the lack of minutes from SGoRR and gold command meetings. Mr Dawson suggested the lack of minutes made it ""difficult"" to understand decision making processes during the pandemic. ""I understand that,"" Ms Forbes replied, adding: ""I think every meeting of that nature in Scottish government should be minuted. I'm surprised to hear that they weren't."" The former minister, who left government in March 2023 , said it was her ""expectation"" that minutes were recorded in the same way that cabinet was. Scotland's Information Commissioner David Hamilton later said the absence of minutes was ""absolutely unacceptable for the public"". He also told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that a ""clear decision process should be there and available so people can look at it"". Mr Hamilton said his office was looking at the evidence on a daily basis and added: ""I think it's an almost certainty that there will be some kind of action."" He told the programme: ""This can't happen again."" Ms Sturgeon is due to give evidence to the inquiry, which is holding special evidence sessions in Edinburgh this month, on Wednesday. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is expected to appear in front of the inquiry on Thursday.

When Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street has been in the weeds of a complex problem and then things go quiet, even cagey, it is often a sign something is coming – and there is a growing confidence they are going to get it sorted.  That's what happened a year ago, when the Windsor Framework emerged. And it's happening again now.  One of the golden rules of UK politics is don’t predict the future in Northern Ireland.  Forgetting this is a remarkably efficient way of daubing your face in the scrambled stuff very publicly.  And – for political leaders – potentially unravelling something very delicately assembled.  And so voices in government talk of a cautious optimism, they’re encouraged but it’s delicate, etc etc.  But, this time, it is looking rather like it is happening.  Tomorrow will come the detail of what is planned, in what is known as a Command Paper. Here is a wholesome blurb about what they are .

Posted at 0:19 0:19 Tomorrow we get the detail - then it's over to Stormont Chris Mason Political editor Half the time, my job is about reading the mood music and understanding how different political teams go about their work. When Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street has been in the weeds of a complex problem and then things go quiet, even cagey, it is often a sign something is coming – and there is a growing confidence they are going to get it sorted. That's what happened a year ago, when the Windsor Framework emerged. And it's happening again now. One of the golden rules of UK politics is don’t predict the future in Northern Ireland. Forgetting this is a remarkably efficient way of daubing your face in the scrambled stuff very publicly. And – for political leaders – potentially unravelling something very delicately assembled. And so voices in government talk of a cautious optimism, they’re encouraged but it’s delicate, etc etc. But, this time, it is looking rather like it is happening. Tomorrow will come the detail of what is planned, in what is known as a Command Paper. Here is a wholesome blurb about what they are . On Thursday, there’ll be a debate in parliament and two Statutory Instruments will be laid to change the law. Talking of wholesome ... And after that, eyes will switch to Stormont.

As we near the end of this live page, here's a look back at what's happened: A new deal meaning no checks on most goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be seen tomorrow, according to DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson He said most goods staying in Northern Ireland will not need checks or customs declarations He also indicated that more details will be shared tomorrow , having first announced the agreement in the early hours of Tuesday We heard plenty of reaction from politicians and political parties, with the Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O'Neill calling it ""a day of optimism"" And speaking from Westminster, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said all conditions were in place for power-sharing to return in Northern Ireland The DUP started boycotting Stormont's power-sharing government nearly two years ago in protest at post-Brexit trade arrangements Article share tools Facebook Twitter Share View more share options Share this post Copy this link Read more about these links.

Asked if reform is necessary, to stop the power-sharing institutions collapsing in the future, she says: ""I think the conversation around reform needs to happen - we need to protect the cornerstones of peace here."" Finally she's asked about the prospect of a first nationalist first minister in Northern Ireland when Stormont returns, given Sinn Féin is now the largest party.

Posted at 23:57 30 Jan 23:57 30 Jan No decision on who will be deputy first minister - Donaldson DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the 'Irish Sea border', the term used to describe trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, will be eliminated in terms of movement of goods by the party's deal with the government. When asked on BBC Newsline whether it is ""truly gone"", he responds: ""In terms of the movement of goods within the United Kingdom, absolutely, yes."" He adds no physical checks will be needed, unless there is suspicion of smuggling or criminal activity. When asked about which of his party members could become deputy first minister, Donaldson says he hasn't ""made any decision on that yet because we're not ready to restore the institutions - we want to be sure that the government takes the steps they've promised"".

Posted at 23:44 30 Jan 23:44 30 Jan 'Make childcare a priority' Getty Copyright: Getty When Stormont politicians do finally return they'll have full in-trays - and some want childcare to be a priority. Families have criticised the gap between childcare provisions in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The chief executive for the charity Employers for Childcare, Marie Marin, says that while the potential return of the executive is welcome news, Northern Ireland's ""long overdue"" new childcare strategy would have to be at the very top of its agenda. ""We now need to see promises translated into policies that put pounds into the pockets of families, and investment into our critical childcare infrastructure – and very quickly,"" she says.

Posted at 23:33 30 Jan 23:33 30 Jan Concerned students urge Stormont to tackle university cost Cormac Campbell BBC News NI South-east reporter At the Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School in Newry, A-level and GCSE students were keen to share their thoughts on what a returning Stormont and its politicians need to do for the next generation. BBC Copyright: BBC For A-level student Euan McKenzie, tackling the looming cost of university is a priority. “The price of university needs to be sorted. It’s almost a certainty now that if you go to university you are going to be knee deep in debt,"" he says. ""It's just not affordable for some people and that’s limiting people’s career choices. I think people are definitely on the edge of making a decision of going or not going because they don’t know if they can afford it or not.” BBC Copyright: BBC Ben Browne echoed Euan's sentiment - and believes there's under-funding, too. “I find myself in that category as well,"" he says, adding that the cost of university is ""one of the big factors that would deter me"". ""I think the government needs to put more effort and funding into the arts. ""A lot is directed to things like the GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association], which I’m also passionate about. I know why money is directed to that sort of thing, but I see a distinct lack of funds for arts and creative elements.""

UFU president David Brown says the absence of local government and ministers meant “many much-needed decisions” hadn’t been taken, on issues like investment and growth as well as key animal health issues such as bovine TB. Brown says that was “frustrating”. “We have yet to fully consider the details of the draft deal that has been proposed.

According to a former MI6 intelligence officer, a secret recording device like this would be ""very easy to procure"". ""This is not, for example, like trying to get hold of a handgun or anything else untoward,"" Matthew Dunn tells BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. It is understood the party leadership thought the speech was being leaked via a mobile phone and asked that all devices be switched off. But the live feed continued to be posted on X. Dunn says that if you did wish to interrupt someone using a wire ""you have to search people"". As someone who used to use covert recording equipment, he says: ""In terms of intercept or any form of disruption, largely my major concern wasn’t a signal being interrupted, it would rather more getting caught with it on my person.""

Posted at 23:02 30 Jan 23:02 30 Jan The moment which will eclipse months of negotiation Chris Mason Political editor Two of the most complex and contentious strands of contemporary politics in collision. Northern Ireland and its painstaking path to peace. The UK’s departure from the European Union. Squaring one with the other has been the central challenge here. Managing borders in a corner of Europe more alive than most to their import, history; symbolism, consequences. Attempts, in private, to assemble the multifarious moving parts to bring about an agreement. Agreement between the government and the DUP. Agreement between the EU and the UK. Agreement among Conservatives. Agreement among the DUP. None of these easy. All of them together, hard. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has finally reached the point he can take the Democratic Unionist Party with him. Or at least most of it. And Sir Jeffrey is a man who knows all about noisy figures deciding their party is going further than they can stomach. He was once that very person, when, 20 years ago, he left the Ulster Unionist Party. And so to the moment, perhaps before the week is out, which will eclipse much of the negotiation of recent months, and the noise of recent days. A Sinn Féin first minister, Michelle O’Neill. Northern Ireland, a part of the UK, whose first minister aspires for it, one day, to be part of another state, the Republic of Ireland. Politics is packed with precedents. But that will be something never seen before. Article share tools Facebook Twitter Share View more share options Share this post Copy this link Read more about these links.

Posted at 22:24 30 Jan 22:24 30 Jan A unseen deal and the complex politics of Northern Ireland Chris Mason Political editor There are two key observations to make right now about what we are seeing in Northern Ireland. We are hearing reaction to a deal we haven't actually seen yet and we are perhaps days away from a Sinn Fein First Minister of Northern Ireland - a landmark moment in history. All of this is about the collision of the complex politics of Northern Ireland and the complex politics of Brexit. Brexit is all about where laws are made and where they are applied. Enter next the complex politics and history of Northern Ireland - and so a desire to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, between Northern Ireland in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in the EU. Now, we await the Command Paper. Does it sufficiently match, in its detail, the rhetoric those who have read it attach to it? Read more of Chris Mason's blog here.

Planned industrial action for later this week is still set to go ahead by public transport workers and school support staff on Thursday. Susan Fitzgerald from Unite said: “As of now, the strikes are still going ahead. We want to see the detail, but even without getting into that, we know that there isn’t enough there to support our public services which are crumbling.” The teachers union NASUWT’s Justin McCamphill echoed a similar reaction: “We don’t know what the implications are going to be for the long term funding of the public sector in Northern Ireland so we look forward to getting that detail.

Posted at 21:54 30 Jan 21:54 30 Jan How does power-sharing work in Northern Ireland? PA Media Copyright: PA Media The principle of power-sharing is what sets Northern Ireland apart from the UK's other nations. It means that in any government there must be representatives from both the nationalist community - who favour unity with the Republic of Ireland - and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. How does it work in practice? A chamber of 90 members (MLAs) is elected to the assembly at least once every five years. Northern Ireland has a first minister and a deputy first minister - one unionist, the other nationalist. The executive, or cabinet, is multi-party - and ministers are drawn from unionist, nationalist and non-aligned parties, based on how many seats they have won in an election. This also means that politicians from smaller parties can be appointed as ministers.

Coveney tells BBC’s Evening Extra Programme the deal is a “really good news story”.

He says the deal ""ensures Northern Ireland benefits fully from UK free trade deals - key elements in our requirements, in our negotiations with the government"". ""I believe that what we have delivered is significant, on checks on goods moving between GB and NI and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks or identity checks save where, as is normal anywhere in the UK, there are suspicions of smuggling or criminal activity. ""On customs paperwork again, customs declarations, supplementary declarations will be gone and we believe this represents a significant change. ""Some people said you’re going to take the green lane, paint it red white and blue and put a flag on it – well if someone wants to put a flag on it, whatever. ""But as far as we’re concerned the green lane will go and be replaced by the UK internal market system that reflects the reality that NI is part of the UK, that goods flowing within the UK flow freely, that was our core key objective.""

1,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/30/ministers-plan-to-push-english-councils-to-sell-assets-to-plug-budget-holes-condemned,"Councils in England are to be encouraged to sell publicly owned buildings and other assets worth up to £23bn under plans being explored by ministers to plug budget shortfalls amid the crisis in local government.  Under plans being examined by Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, councils would be given greater flexibility to use money raised from asset disposals to meet their budget pressures.  In a consultation with town hall bosses closing on Wednesday, ministers estimate that councils have “investment properties” worth £23.2bn which could be disposed of to help meet budget shortfalls with proposed changes to the rules that would allow sales without government approval.  The government said its aim was to encourage the sale of assets held only for revenue, and not buildings or places used for the “delivering of the objectives of the local authority”.  However, critics warned of a “fire sale” of public assets amid the multibillion-pound funding shortfall for local authorities across the country.  Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting, said he welcomed councils being handed greater flexibility, but warned it was a “sticking plaster” solution because it would not address longer-term pressures on their finances.  “We’re in a short-term, last-chance saloon place where councils won’t go bust, but in no way does it offer a medium-term solution,” he said.  “The truth is councils are being incentivised to dispose of assets to use those capital resources to fund their revenue budgets, which is appalling. They need to be properly funded by taxation.  “You would not recommend to any other country in the world to fund their public finances this way. It’s a sort of directive to break the rules – an allowance given to break all known usual accounting convention.”  Dozens of councils have already earmarked libraries, civic halls, swimming pools and community centres for sale to raise hundreds of millions of pounds, including in Leeds, Kent, Somerset and Woking.  However, property experts warned the moment to sell could hardly be worse amid a slump in the market driven by near-stagnant growth in the UK economy and higher borrowing costs from the Bank of England.  “If you were trying to identify the worst moment to sell, the first half of 2024 would probably be it,” said Mat Oakley, head of UK and European commercial property research at the leading estate agent Savills.  “A potential buyer will say: ‘They have to sell this, how little can I get away with paying them for it?’ I wouldn’t advise anyone to sell now just because there is that hint of blood in the water.”  Handing councils greater flexibility could, however, help some local authorities to unwind risky investments made using billions of pounds in taxpayer-funded borrowing. Councils including Woking, Thurrock, and Warrington have ploughed vast sums into assets ranging from skyscrapers and shopping centres to solar farms and stadiums.  However, many assets bought in recent years are likely to be worth less than councils paid for them. Figures from Capital Economics show capital values have dropped by about 20% since mid-2022, with offices recording a fall of 23%.  There are worries that much-loved community buildings will also be listed for sale. Analysis by the IPPR thinktank last year found 75,000 public assets, worth about £15bn, had been sold by English councils since 2010, in part to plug holes in their budgets.  Zoë Billingham, director of IPPR North, said: “It’s one-off capital receipt to fund ongoing revenue pressures, which will last for as long as they have buildings to sell. I don’t think that’s a good thing. It’s not a fix.  “It’s also a one-way street. Once public assets have been sold, I would be shocked to hear at a future date any council or government will buy them back. It’s a temporary fix for a difficult time. It’s not sustainable.”  A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We are engaging with the sector over options that will allow councils greater financial flexibilities to make savings and better manage their own budgets overall.  “We want to ensure every penny of taxpayer money is well spent and are carefully considering what proportionate safeguards are needed.  “We have recently announced an additional £600m support package for councils across England, increasing their overall proposed funding for next year to £64.7bn, a 7.5% increase in cash terms.”","Ministers plan to push cash-strapped English councils to sell assets | England | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland Birmingham’s central library, which is owned by the council but could be at risk of being sold.

It’s not sustainable.” A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We are engaging with the sector over options that will allow councils greater financial flexibilities to make savings and better manage their own budgets overall. “We want to ensure every penny of taxpayer money is well spent and are carefully considering what proportionate safeguards are needed. “We have recently announced an additional £600m support package for councils across England, increasing their overall proposed funding for next year to £64.7bn, a 7.5% increase in cash terms.” Explore more on these topics England Councils in crisis Local government Austerity Tax and spending Real estate Public finance Commercial property news Reuse this content More on this story More on this story How a decade of austerity has squeezed council budgets in England 1d ago From Kirklees to Croydon, some historic buildings English councils could sell 9h ago Austerity casts an ever-longer shadow over Tory and Labour economic policies 24 Nov 2023 English councils to get extra £600m funding to ease soaring costs 6d ago Head of OBR says lack of budget details led to ‘work of fiction’ forecasts last year 23 Jan 2024 Which public services will suffer most to pay for Tory tax cuts? 23 Nov 2023 Households in England face above-inflation £2bn council tax raid 1d ago As Britain’s town hall services crumble, the case for reform is overwhelming 1 Oct 2023 Jeremy Hunt has room for £20bn tax cuts after borrowing halves year on year 23 Jan 2024 More than 40 Tory MPs threaten rebellion over English council funding 22 Jan 2024 Most viewed Most viewed UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ministers are considering introducing the requirement alongside a need for all applicants to show a two-year connection to the local area. They have also announced new powers to ban people from social homes for up to five years for anti-social behaviour. Those without the right to live in the UK are generally ineligible already. Labour's housing secretary Angela Rayner called the announcement ""absolute rubbish"", as some people already on waiting lists were waiting more than a decade to access social housing. Ministers were ""gaslighting people who can't get homes,"" she told ITV, adding ""they can't give British homes for British people"". Housing Minister Lee Rowley said the rules would ensure ""decent and hardworking people that have contributed to this country"" would get priority for social housing. He added it would also mean ""local law-abiding citizens in need have more access to a home,"" adding that social housing was ""finite"". A consultation on the plans will run until 26 March, with changes then delivered ""at the earliest opportunity"" by amending housing laws. What's happened to the government's housebuilding target? Gove: I will act against councils failing on housing Applications for social housing in England are determined by local councils, which can set their own eligibility terms. But they are required to follow some nationwide rules, including when putting people forward from their waiting lists to live in properties owned by housing associations. These generally require foreign nationals to have settled status in the UK and be eligible for state benefits to apply. Under the planned ""UK connection test"" they would also have to live in the UK for a continuous period of 10 years before qualifying. The government says this period is at the ""upper limit"" of the time that non-British citizens currently have to live in the UK before gaining settled status under the various routes to do so. This new test would not apply to Irish citizens, Commonwealth citizens with right of abode, or qualifying EU citizens. It would also not apply to refugees who come to the UK through designated safe and legal routes. The government has also set out plans for a blanket two-year local residency requirement. Many, but not all, councils currently enforce their own local connection tests. According to officials figures, 90% of lead tenants in new social housing lets in England were UK nationals - but the figures do vary between local areas. 'Three strikes' Under the planned rules shake-up, those punished for anti-social behaviour could be barred from social housing for up to five years. The government has said this will be subject to a ""three strikes and you're out"" policy, with three sanctions leading to a ban. Ministers will also look at introducing a maximum household income threshold for new social housing applications, which will not apply to existing tenants. The government has said it has no plans to change existing rules on how people who qualify for waiting lists are then prioritised for housing. Those who are given preference currently include the legally homeless, and people living in insanitary or overcrowded housing. There are also rules to ensure military veterans and those fleeing violence are not disadvantaged by residence requirements. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said ""serious policy and proper funding"" was required to deliver tens of thousands of social homes. Chief executive Kate Henderson added that social housing was ""all the more scarce because of huge cuts in government funding"" and the government's Right to Buy policy . The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it had raised concerns that extending qualification periods for social housing could lead to a rise in homelessness. Cllr Darren Rodwell, the group's housing spokesman, said the policy was ""symptomatic of our wider housing shortage"", and called for councils to be given financial flexibility to resume their ""historic role as a major builder of affordable homes"".

Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - has reached near-record highs in recent times, prompting a cost-of-living crisis. However, discounts and lower prices for milk and tea saw shop price inflation fall to 2.9%, from 4% in December. Overall, prices are still going up in the shops but at a slower rate. On average, food prices are still rising by more than 6% a year. The BRC, which represents some of the UK's biggest retailers, said shop price inflation in January was at its lowest level since May 2022. Discounts after New Year also helped to slow down the rate of price increases for non-food products, which eased to 1.3%, down from 3.1% the month before. However, the BRC warned in its report that many households had not felt the benefit of lower inflation, adding there were risks that price rises could accelerate once more. Rate cuts still expected despite inflation uptick What is the UK inflation rate and how does it affect me? Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said progress in slowing price rises was likely to be hampered by other cost pressures, including implementing the increase in the National Living Wage, and an increase in business rates in April. ""Rising geopolitical tensions will also add to uncertainty and costs in supply chains. With a general election later this year, we want to see political parties outline how they will help unlock investment across the country, rather than the current trajectory, which is doing just the opposite,"" Ms Dickinson said. Dry January Separate data from research company Kantar said food price inflation fell at a slower rate in January due to fewer people buying promotional items compared with December. It said some 86 million more lunchboxes were taken to work in 2023 as people sought to manage budgets more closely. ""As consumers across the country took on Dry January, spending on alcohol fell by more than half compared with December, said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Almost 6% of beer packs sold in January were no or low-alcohol options, marking a jump from 4% at the end of last year. Sales of own-label plant-based ranges increased by 8% on the month as Veganuary got under way, Kantar said. Some analysts fear inflation will stay elevated, following attacks on ships using a vital trade route through the Red Sea . Several shipping firms have stopped vessels using the route after the attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Last week, the US and UK launched military strikes against the Houthis. But Mr McKevitt said: ""There's been a lot of speculation about the impact the Red Sea shipping crisis might have on the cost of goods, but the story in the grocery aisles this January is more about the battle between the supermarkets to offer best value, rather than geopolitics. ""Retailers have taken their foot off the promotions gas slightly as we've come into the New Year, and that's meant inflation hasn't fallen as quickly."" He added attention would now turn to Valentine's Day to see if couples opt for more low-key celebrations again, like they did in 2023. However, although tobacco and alcohol prices remain high, there is some hope that headline inflation could fall to nearer the Bank of England's 2% target as energy bills are predicted to come down in 2024. The predicted fall in the inflation rate has fuelled hopes that the Bank will cut its key interest rate, which currently stands at a 15-year high. The Bank has increased interest rates 14 times since December 2021 in an attempt to tackle inflation, which has strained the finances of UK households over the past two years.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on Telegram that drones had struck a civilian home and started a fire when explosions were heard in the city at around 10:40pm local time.  The regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that at least six drones had been launched in the Slobidskyi and Saltivskyi districts of the region.  It comes as Russian troops have mistakenly bombed their own territory for the fourth time in one month, the UK’s defence ministry has said.  In their latest intelligence update, the MoD said that Russian aircrafts accidentally discharged two unguided munitions on two Russian villages in the Belgorod area.  Citing a Russian Telegram news channel Astra, they said the first bomb landed on a farm in Postnikov, whilst the second landed on an urban street in Strelestkoye - prompting an evacuation of up to 150 civilians.  “The increasing frequency of these occurrences likely demonstrates a degree of air and ground crew fatigue within the Russian front line, as well as exposing inadequate training,” the UK’s latest defence intelligence update read.","uk news - Google Search Please click here if you are not redirected within a few seconds.

That's according to a new map - the most comprehensive to date - of these historic features of the landscape. Ecologists hope the data will lead to better protections for the much-loved lines of trees and shrubs that provide food and shelter for wildlife, and store large amounts of carbon. Laser scanning from the air reveals a total of 390,000 km of hedges. The South West boasts the most hedgerows, led by Cornwall. Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire are the counties with the least - excluding big urban areas. ""We've probably got more hedgerows in England than anywhere else in the world so we're very lucky to have this huge resource,""  said Dr Richard Broughton of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who led the project. ""As a national policy, we're trying to expand hedgerows in this country, and this will tell us where there are gaps in the hedgerow network that we could fill in."" Hedgerows have been part of the rural fabric of Britain since the Bronze Age, marking out boundaries and keeping in cattle. They contain hundreds of different wild plants, provide shelter for nesting birds, small mammals and insects, and can capture and store large amounts of carbon. About half of Britain's hedgerows were lost between the 1940s and 1990s, mostly in England, due to intensive farming and development While the loss has slowed since the 1990s, neglect, damage and removal remain big threats. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Hedgerows are part of the cultural landscape of Britain The new map is based on aerial laser scanning of England's entire landscape using Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing data. Previous analyses have relied on estimates scaled up from field surveys. ""This is the first time we've been able to map with Lidar the whole country, which means that you don't have to walk every hedgerow,"" said Dr Broughton. ""You can just do a sample of it and then scale up from there. This gives us more detail than we've had before on such a large scale."" The new data calculates there are 390,000 km of hedgerows in England measuring between 1 and 6 metres in height. Additionally, there are another 67,000 km of lower hedges and a further 185,000 km of overgrown hedges above 6m tall. The map found: The South West has the greatest share (24% of England's hedges). Excluding London, the northeast has the lowest share (4%). The other regions have 11-13% each. At a county level, Somerset, Derbyshire and Cornwall have the highest densities of hedgerows (hedgerow per km of each county). Excluding urban areas, the lowest densities are in Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire. The government has promised to create or restore 48,000 km of hedgerows by 2037, and 72,000 km of hedgerows by 2050, under the new Environmental Improvement Plan released a year ago.

Loyalists protest outside a Democratic Unionist Party meeting in Lisburn, Northern Ireland on Monday night. Peter Morrison / AP Print Jan. 30, 2024, 1:38 PM PKT / Source : The Associated Press By The Associated Press Northern Ireland’s largest British unionist party has agreed to end a boycott that left the region’s people without a power-sharing administration for two years, it said Tuesday — a breakthrough that could see the shuttered Belfast government restored within days. After a late-night meeting, Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the party’s executive has backed proposals to return to the government. He said agreements reached with the U.K. government in London “provide a basis for our party to nominate members to the Northern Ireland Executive, thus seeing the restoration of the locally elected institutions.” The breakthrough came after the U.K. government last week gave Northern Ireland politicians until Feb. 8 to restore the collapsed government in Belfast or face new elections. Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson leaves his party headquarters in east Belfast on Monday night. Peter Morrison / AP “All the conditions are in place for the Assembly to return,” Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said. “The parties entitled to form an Executive are meeting today to discuss these matters, and I hope to be able to finalize this deal with the political parties as soon as possible.” The DUP walked out in February 2022 in a dispute over post-Brexit trade rules. Ever since, it has refused to return to the government with the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein. Under power-sharing rules established as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process, the administration must include both British unionists and Irish nationalists. The walkout left Northern Ireland’s 1.9 million people without a functioning administration to make key decisions as the cost of living soared and backlogs strained the creaking public health system. Teachers, nurses and other public sector workers in Northern Ireland staged a 24-hour strike this month calling on politicians to return to the government and give them a long-delayed pay raise. The British government has agreed to give Northern Ireland more than 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) for its public services, but only if the executive in Belfast gets back up and running. The DUP quit the government in opposition to the new trade rules put in place after the U.K. left the European Union in 2020 that imposed customs checks and other hurdles on goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. The checks were imposed to maintain an open border between the north and its EU neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process. The DUP, though, says the new east-west customs border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the U.K. In February 2023, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a deal to ease customs checks and other hurdles for goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. But it was not enough for the DUP, which continued its government boycott. Donaldson said further measures agreed by the British government would “remove checks for goods moving within the U.K. and remaining in Northern Ireland and will end Northern Ireland automatically following future EU laws.” The DUP’s decision faces opposition from some hard-line unionists, who fiercely guard Northern Ireland’s place in the U.K. and say even light-touch post-Brexit checks create a de facto internal trade barrier. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the DUP meeting venue outside Belfast late Monday, waving placards saying, “Stop DUP sellout.” Donaldson said last week that he had received threats over his attempts to negotiate a return to the government. “I think my party has displayed far more courage than those who threaten or try to bully or try to misrepresent us,” he said Tuesday. “We are determined to take our place in taking Northern Ireland forward.” The Associated Press About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Cookie Notice CA Notice Terms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023) NBC News Sitemap Closed Captioning Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo Cookie Notice This Cookie Notice (“Notice”) explains how NBCUniversal and its affiliates (“NBCUniversal” or “we”), along with our partners, including advertisers and vendors, use cookies and similar tracking technologies when you use our websites, applications, such as games, interactive TV, voice-activated assistants, and other services that link to this policy, as well as connected devices, including those used in our theme parks (“Services”).

Analysis Posted at 22:21 30 Jan 22:21 30 Jan Forbes focused on the system, not individuals Georgia Roberts BBC Scotland Westminster correspondent PA Media Copyright: PA Media Relations between the UK government and Scottish government have been a running theme of questioning in these hearings. Other witnesses from the Scottish government have highlighted frustration at the often last minute communication of information or a lack of access to information and singled out key UK government ministers in their criticism. Kate Forbes, whilst agreeing with those difficulties, chose not to do this earlier. She agreed there were hurdles, highlighted examples where the Scottish government would find out additional funding had been announced for a certain area 24 hours after her team had been told none was available, and how that would’ve aided Scotland’s own planning processes immensely. But she didn't put it down to a case of personalities and politics, rather she blamed the system that’s in place for funding towards Scotland from the UK government that didn’t give budget guarantees and sufficient flexibilities. It’s clear that Forbes was well-liked in UK government by some senior figures, with Michael Gove yesterday calling her among the more constructive ministers to work with during the pandemic.

Posted at 22:14 30 Jan 22:14 30 Jan The key things to know from today That was a mammoth evidence session from Scotland's former Deputy First Minister John Swinney , in which he discussed - among other things - deleting Covid-related messages to then FM Nicola Sturgeon. Here's what he told the inquiry: Swinney said he manually deleted messages with Sturgeon during the pandemic - he said this was in line with government policy and he made sure his private office was told of any relevant material Scotland's former education secretary said he felt there was no alternative to closing schools during the second lockdown He rejected suggestions that Sturgeon took decisions herself, without consulting her cabinet, but admitted some choices - including closing schools - were taken by him and Sturgeon alone Swinney, also the former deputy first minister, was questioned on the so-called gold command meetings - gatherings involving Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and ministers - and admitted notes should've been circulated Before him, we heard from former Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes , who said she wasn't initially invited to these special meetings and expressed surprise that there was no official record of them. Here's what else she said: Forbes said she did not delete any of her WhatsApp messages with senior colleagues during the pandemic - she told the inquiry that she later became aware of a policy that required this to happen She admitted there should have been ""a lot more discussion on how to budget for the pandemic"" ahead of her first Budget in March 2020 Article share tools Facebook Twitter Share View more share options Share this post Copy this link Read more about these links. Posted at 21:59 30 Jan 21:59 30 Jan Swinney ends evidence by criticising UK Scotland Secretary Jack BBC Copyright: BBC Bringing today's hearing to an end, John Swinney 's questioned by Claire Mitchell KC on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Scotland group. Mitchell quotes written evidence submitted by Swinney in which he says he experienced “no tangible presence” of the UK government's Scotland Secretary Alister Jack in any aspect of the handling of the pandemic, and asks whether any efforts were made to engage him. “The short answer’s probably no, because there was no real value in it,” Swinney says, adding: Quote Message: In my experience, the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of any useful value in assisting us in that process."" In my experience, the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of any useful value in assisting us in that process."" He adds that he would not say the same thing about Jack’s predecessor, David Mundell, who was Scottish Secretary from 2015-19. That's it for today's session, and for our live text updates. We're going to bring you a round-up of what we learnt in just a moment - hang tight.

There's some time allotted to Claire Mitchell KC , though, on behalf of the Scottish Covid bereaved group - but not before a small ask from the inquiry's chair Lady Hallett. With a smile on her face, she tells Swinney that he's not the only politician she's had to say this to, but he's ""inclined to give very long answers"". ""Ms Mitchell has limited time so to be fair to those she represents, the Scottish bereaved, please could you try and focus on her questions,"" she asks of Swinney, who apologises.

Posted at 21:36 30 Jan 21:36 30 Jan Swinney defends relationship with councils Conversation now turns to the relationship between the Scottish government and local authorities during Covid, which John Swinney indicates he thought was good. Inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson KC quotes a number of councils who say they felt the Scottish government made decisions without involving them. Asked if his assertion that he had a good working relationship with local authorities was perhaps misguided, the former deputy first minister says he's ""sorry that's how they feel"". He adds that he's disappointed people don't share his view there was an equal partnership and, again, defends his relations with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla).

John Swinney , Scotland's former deputy first minister, is asked why the Scottish government opted for a five-tier lockdown system - compared with England's three tier-system. He says the difference in each country's geographical landscape was taken into consideration. ""We judged that we needed to have sufficient amount of variation between levels to take account of some very different circumstances in Scotland geographically and in demographic terms,"" Swinney tells the inquiry.

Analysis Posted at 21:33 30 Jan 21:33 30 Jan Another blow to Sturgeon and Swinney's decision-making process Kirsten Campbell BBC Scotland political correspondent Most parents in Scotland will tell you they developed a new respect for the teaching profession after home-schooling their children during the Covid pandemic. We've now learned the closure of schools wasn't underpinned by legislation, but was ""an expression of leadership in a desperate moment"". This wasn't a decision taken in cabinet, it was one taken by John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon after a cabinet meeting. It's a prime example of one of the themes that the inquiry has been teasing out, as to whether the cabinet was there to make decisions - or to ratify conclusions reached by the first minister. The inquiry has heard from one epidemiologist who said it was unnecessary. He spoke movingly about the impact closures had on children. But Swinney indicated that wasn't the advice that he had on his desk. He said with parental anxiety growing and attendance deteriorating, clarity was needed.

Posted at 21:26 30 Jan 21:26 30 Jan Swinney: Would have been reckless to ignore epidemiological advice Swinney says an audit commissioned by the Scottish government in the summer of 2020, about the impact of school closures, showed ""there had been a negative impact on children's learning and development"" in the first lockdown. Asked by inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson if he had this information by the time he decided to close schools in the second lockdown, Swinney says: ""Yes but I did not feel I had an alternative because of ... the deeply serious situation that we faced and I didn't in all honesty think I could ignore the epidemiological advice that was being put in front of me.""

Posted at 21:20 30 Jan 21:20 30 Jan Swinney pushed on failure to reopen schools earlier BBC Copyright: BBC Still on school closures, John Swinney tells the Covid inquiry he didn't have the evidence in front of him to support opening schools earlier than they were. The inquiry lawyer says epidemiological professionals have since pointed out it would've been  safe to do so, to which Swinney says ""that's not the advice I had in front of me"". Swinney goes on to say that during the second lockdown, the number of pupils being educated in schools was greater than in the first. He insists that the epidemiological information and the condition of the pandemic were driving"" all the decisions that he took in relation to schools reopening.

Posted at 21:15 30 Jan 21:15 30 Jan No checks on children's mental health before schools closed, Swinney admits John Swinney 's being pushed for clarity on what impact assessments - if any - were made before schools in Scotland were closed during the pandemic. The former deputy first minister says there was neither the ""time or opportunity to carry those out"" - but local authorities were ""encouraged to ensure appropriate provision of education was put in place"" for pupils. Further assessments on children's mental health and those with disabilities or learning difficulties were also not carried out ""at that moment"", he says, adding Quote Message: We wanted - and we made clear - that the resumption of full time face-to-face education was of the highest priority for the Scottish government.""

Posted at 21:09 30 Jan 21:09 30 Jan Swinney says decision to close schools made by him and Sturgeon More now on Scotland's decision to close schools back in 2020. Swinney says the Scottish government relied on advice from the UK government’s Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] advisory body when taking the decision. The inquiry lawyer asks whether the reliance was appropriate given that the situation in London at that point was worse than in Scotland. “I think it was because I think it was pretty clear that what was happening in London was coming our way, and it would be coming our way pretty shortly thereafter,” he says. Swinney also acknowledges that the decision to close schools was taken during a conversation only between him and the then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, not in a discussion involving the full cabinet. He said this was because ""events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace"" .

Posted at 21:06 30 Jan 21:06 30 Jan 'We were in danger of operating an unsafe situation' Inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson KC , asking the questions today, says he wants to return to the issue of school closure during the pandemic. He asks John Swinney about informal conversations he had with then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon which led to schools being closed towards the end of March 2020, despite there not yet being scientific evidence to back the decision up. The former deputy FM says that on the evening of 17 March, he was provided with advice from education officials who thought it likely Sage would conclude the next day that there would be epidemiology evidence to back closures. He adds that there was data showing a declining number of staff and students attending schools due to Covid. ""We were in danger of operating an unsafe situation,"" he says.

Posted at 20:57 30 Jan 20:57 30 Jan Public opinion didn't influence government, Swinney says Swinney 's being asked if the Scottish government's decisions were ever influenced by the ""perceived tolerance"" of the Scottish people. The former deputy first minister denies ever being swayed by public opinion. He says people ""understood the seriousness of the situation we faced"" and showed ""remarkable willingness to play their part"" in the fight against Covid. He does, however, acknowledge people's frustration with the pandemic and the decisions being made at the time. ""We just had to be open"" about the challenges Scotland faced, he adds.

Posted at 20:52 30 Jan 20:52 30 Jan Inquiry chair intervenes to clarify Swinney's answer BBC Copyright: BBC Still on Scotland's second lockdown in 2021, inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson suggests that the decision made to go into it was based solely on trying to suppress Covid - taking no notice or assessment of the other harms that would be done by another lockdown. ""That is a way of looking at it,"" John Swinney replies. The inquiry's chair Lady Hallett intervenes here to ask whether the answer to Dawson's question was yes or no, to which Swinney says: ""I suppose the answer is yes"". ""We took a decision based on the direct health harm because of the extremity of the situation we faced,"" he explains. Swinney says he didn't much like Dawson's wording, which is why his answer seemed unclear.

He describes the period before the decision as a ""terrifying couple of days"". “The harm one [direct health impact of Covid] evidence was absolutely terrifying about what was coming our way,” he recalls, adding that the ""circumstances were very similar, if not identical, to the situation we faced in March 2020"". ""Whichever way you looked at the evidence, it was just impossible to see any way through it other than having to take significant intervention to arrest the pace of the pandemic,"" Swinney tells the inquiry.

John Swinney replies by saying he's ""sorry if any individual feels that way"". He says the government was trying to return society to as much normality as it could whilst supressing the virus. The former deputy first minister adds he took the best decisions he could at the time - he's acknowledged already that sometimes no option was ideal.

Posted at 20:25 30 Jan 20:25 30 Jan 'We had to let people live slightly more normally' BBC Copyright: BBC We're back from a break now - just before it, John Swinney mentioned schools reopening in Scotland in August 2020. He said this was because there had been a very significant drop in Covid cases over the summer. Therefore the government ""had to try to enable people to live lives slightly more normally"", with education one of the most important priorities. Swinney did, however, acknowledge that the early opening of schools may have contributed to a sudden rise in Covid cases thereafter.

Analysis Posted at 20:19 30 Jan 20:19 30 Jan A rare opportunity to see messages between senior ministers David Wallace Lockhart Political correspondent While the inquiry has a brief recess, let's recall something that's come up more than once today. We've been shown two WhatsApp conversations that refer to a moment in cabinet, in December 2021, when Humza Yousaf said £100m of the health budget could be redirected towards business support. It looks like some attendees were unhappy at him bringing this up for the first time at the cabinet table. Kate Forbes, who gave evidence this morning, said to an official she’d “never seen the FM [Nicola Sturgeon] this angry in all my cabinets”. Yousaf messaged National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch to say Sturgeon was “not remotely happy”. Prof Leitch replied to say Sturgeon was “absolutely ridiculous”. Most political journalists would love to be a fly on the wall for cabinet meetings. But this rare opportunity to see WhatsApp messages in the wake of discussions is probably the next best thing.

Analysis Posted at 22:21 30 Jan 22:21 30 Jan Forbes focused on the system, not individuals Georgia Roberts BBC Scotland Westminster correspondent PA Media Copyright: PA Media Relations between the UK government and Scottish government have been a running theme of questioning in these hearings. Other witnesses from the Scottish government have highlighted frustration at the often last minute communication of information or a lack of access to information and singled out key UK government ministers in their criticism. Kate Forbes, whilst agreeing with those difficulties, chose not to do this earlier. She agreed there were hurdles, highlighted examples where the Scottish government would find out additional funding had been announced for a certain area 24 hours after her team had been told none was available, and how that would’ve aided Scotland’s own planning processes immensely. But she didn't put it down to a case of personalities and politics, rather she blamed the system that’s in place for funding towards Scotland from the UK government that didn’t give budget guarantees and sufficient flexibilities. It’s clear that Forbes was well-liked in UK government by some senior figures, with Michael Gove yesterday calling her among the more constructive ministers to work with during the pandemic.

Posted at 22:14 30 Jan 22:14 30 Jan The key things to know from today That was a mammoth evidence session from Scotland's former Deputy First Minister John Swinney , in which he discussed - among other things - deleting Covid-related messages to then FM Nicola Sturgeon. Here's what he told the inquiry: Swinney said he manually deleted messages with Sturgeon during the pandemic - he said this was in line with government policy and he made sure his private office was told of any relevant material Scotland's former education secretary said he felt there was no alternative to closing schools during the second lockdown He rejected suggestions that Sturgeon took decisions herself, without consulting her cabinet, but admitted some choices - including closing schools - were taken by him and Sturgeon alone Swinney, also the former deputy first minister, was questioned on the so-called gold command meetings - gatherings involving Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and ministers - and admitted notes should've been circulated Before him, we heard from former Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes , who said she wasn't initially invited to these special meetings and expressed surprise that there was no official record of them. Here's what else she said: Forbes said she did not delete any of her WhatsApp messages with senior colleagues during the pandemic - she told the inquiry that she later became aware of a policy that required this to happen She admitted there should have been ""a lot more discussion on how to budget for the pandemic"" ahead of her first Budget in March 2020 Article share tools Facebook Twitter Share View more share options Share this post Copy this link Read more about these links. Posted at 21:59 30 Jan 21:59 30 Jan Swinney ends evidence by criticising UK Scotland Secretary Jack BBC Copyright: BBC Bringing today's hearing to an end, John Swinney 's questioned by Claire Mitchell KC on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Scotland group. Mitchell quotes written evidence submitted by Swinney in which he says he experienced “no tangible presence” of the UK government's Scotland Secretary Alister Jack in any aspect of the handling of the pandemic, and asks whether any efforts were made to engage him. “The short answer’s probably no, because there was no real value in it,” Swinney says, adding: Quote Message: In my experience, the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of any useful value in assisting us in that process."" In my experience, the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of any useful value in assisting us in that process."" He adds that he would not say the same thing about Jack’s predecessor, David Mundell, who was Scottish Secretary from 2015-19. That's it for today's session, and for our live text updates.

There's some time allotted to Claire Mitchell KC , though, on behalf of the Scottish Covid bereaved group - but not before a small ask from the inquiry's chair Lady Hallett. With a smile on her face, she tells Swinney that he's not the only politician she's had to say this to, but he's ""inclined to give very long answers"". ""Ms Mitchell has limited time so to be fair to those she represents, the Scottish bereaved, please could you try and focus on her questions,"" she asks of Swinney, who apologises.

Posted at 21:36 30 Jan 21:36 30 Jan Swinney defends relationship with councils Conversation now turns to the relationship between the Scottish government and local authorities during Covid, which John Swinney indicates he thought was good. Inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson KC quotes a number of councils who say they felt the Scottish government made decisions without involving them. Asked if his assertion that he had a good working relationship with local authorities was perhaps misguided, the former deputy first minister says he's ""sorry that's how they feel"". He adds that he's disappointed people don't share his view there was an equal partnership and, again, defends his relations with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla).

John Swinney , Scotland's former deputy first minister, is asked why the Scottish government opted for a five-tier lockdown system - compared with England's three tier-system. He says the difference in each country's geographical landscape was taken into consideration. ""We judged that we needed to have sufficient amount of variation between levels to take account of some very different circumstances in Scotland geographically and in demographic terms,"" Swinney tells the inquiry.

Analysis Posted at 21:33 30 Jan 21:33 30 Jan Another blow to Sturgeon and Swinney's decision-making process Kirsten Campbell BBC Scotland political correspondent Most parents in Scotland will tell you they developed a new respect for the teaching profession after home-schooling their children during the Covid pandemic. We've now learned the closure of schools wasn't underpinned by legislation, but was ""an expression of leadership in a desperate moment"". This wasn't a decision taken in cabinet, it was one taken by John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon after a cabinet meeting. It's a prime example of one of the themes that the inquiry has been teasing out, as to whether the cabinet was there to make decisions - or to ratify conclusions reached by the first minister. The inquiry has heard from one epidemiologist who said it was unnecessary. He spoke movingly about the impact closures had on children. But Swinney indicated that wasn't the advice that he had on his desk. He said with parental anxiety growing and attendance deteriorating, clarity was needed.

Posted at 21:26 30 Jan 21:26 30 Jan Swinney: Would have been reckless to ignore epidemiological advice Swinney says an audit commissioned by the Scottish government in the summer of 2020, about the impact of school closures, showed ""there had been a negative impact on children's learning and development"" in the first lockdown. Asked by inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson if he had this information by the time he decided to close schools in the second lockdown, Swinney says: ""Yes but I did not feel I had an alternative because of ... the deeply serious situation that we faced and I didn't in all honesty think I could ignore the epidemiological advice that was being put in front of me.""

The inquiry lawyer says epidemiological professionals have since pointed out it would've been  safe to do so, to which Swinney says ""that's not the advice I had in front of me"". Swinney goes on to say that during the second lockdown, the number of pupils being educated in schools was greater than in the first. He insists that the epidemiological information and the condition of the pandemic were driving"" all the decisions that he took in relation to schools reopening.

The former deputy first minister says there was neither the ""time or opportunity to carry those out"" - but local authorities were ""encouraged to ensure appropriate provision of education was put in place"" for pupils. Further assessments on children's mental health and those with disabilities or learning difficulties were also not carried out ""at that moment"", he says, adding Quote Message: We wanted - and we made clear - that the resumption of full time face-to-face education was of the highest priority for the Scottish government.""

Posted at 21:09 30 Jan 21:09 30 Jan Swinney says decision to close schools made by him and Sturgeon More now on Scotland's decision to close schools back in 2020. Swinney says the Scottish government relied on advice from the UK government’s Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] advisory body when taking the decision. The inquiry lawyer asks whether the reliance was appropriate given that the situation in London at that point was worse than in Scotland. “I think it was because I think it was pretty clear that what was happening in London was coming our way, and it would be coming our way pretty shortly thereafter,” he says. Swinney also acknowledges that the decision to close schools was taken during a conversation only between him and the then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, not in a discussion involving the full cabinet. He said this was because ""events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace"" .

Posted at 21:06 30 Jan 21:06 30 Jan 'We were in danger of operating an unsafe situation' Inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson KC , asking the questions today, says he wants to return to the issue of school closure during the pandemic. He asks John Swinney about informal conversations he had with then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon which led to schools being closed towards the end of March 2020, despite there not yet being scientific evidence to back the decision up. The former deputy FM says that on the evening of 17 March, he was provided with advice from education officials who thought it likely Sage would conclude the next day that there would be epidemiology evidence to back closures. He adds that there was data showing a declining number of staff and students attending schools due to Covid. ""We were in danger of operating an unsafe situation,"" he says.

The former deputy first minister denies ever being swayed by public opinion. He says people ""understood the seriousness of the situation we faced"" and showed ""remarkable willingness to play their part"" in the fight against Covid. He does, however, acknowledge people's frustration with the pandemic and the decisions being made at the time. ""We just had to be open"" about the challenges Scotland faced, he adds.

Posted at 20:52 30 Jan 20:52 30 Jan Inquiry chair intervenes to clarify Swinney's answer BBC Copyright: BBC Still on Scotland's second lockdown in 2021, inquiry lawyer Jamie Dawson suggests that the decision made to go into it was based solely on trying to suppress Covid - taking no notice or assessment of the other harms that would be done by another lockdown. ""That is a way of looking at it,"" John Swinney replies. The inquiry's chair Lady Hallett intervenes here to ask whether the answer to Dawson's question was yes or no, to which Swinney says: ""I suppose the answer is yes"". ""We took a decision based on the direct health harm because of the extremity of the situation we faced,"" he explains.

He describes the period before the decision as a ""terrifying couple of days"". “The harm one [direct health impact of Covid] evidence was absolutely terrifying about what was coming our way,” he recalls, adding that the ""circumstances were very similar, if not identical, to the situation we faced in March 2020"". ""Whichever way you looked at the evidence, it was just impossible to see any way through it other than having to take significant intervention to arrest the pace of the pandemic,"" Swinney tells the inquiry.

John Swinney replies by saying he's ""sorry if any individual feels that way"". He says the government was trying to return society to as much normality as it could whilst supressing the virus.

Posted at 20:25 30 Jan 20:25 30 Jan 'We had to let people live slightly more normally' BBC Copyright: BBC We're back from a break now - just before it, John Swinney mentioned schools reopening in Scotland in August 2020. He said this was because there had been a very significant drop in Covid cases over the summer. Therefore the government ""had to try to enable people to live lives slightly more normally"", with education one of the most important priorities. Swinney did, however, acknowledge that the early opening of schools may have contributed to a sudden rise in Covid cases thereafter.

Analysis Posted at 20:19 30 Jan 20:19 30 Jan A rare opportunity to see messages between senior ministers David Wallace Lockhart Political correspondent While the inquiry has a brief recess, let's recall something that's come up more than once today. We've been shown two WhatsApp conversations that refer to a moment in cabinet, in December 2021, when Humza Yousaf said £100m of the health budget could be redirected towards business support. It looks like some attendees were unhappy at him bringing this up for the first time at the cabinet table. Kate Forbes, who gave evidence this morning, said to an official she’d “never seen the FM [Nicola Sturgeon] this angry in all my cabinets”. Yousaf messaged National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch to say Sturgeon was “not remotely happy”. Prof Leitch replied to say Sturgeon was “absolutely ridiculous”. Most political journalists would love to be a fly on the wall for cabinet meetings. But this rare opportunity to see WhatsApp messages in the wake of discussions is probably the next best thing.

1,https://www.ipe.com/news/uk-government-confirms-final-db-scheme-funding-regulations/10071332.article,"The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has published the final funding and investment regulations which are set to come into force from April 2024.  The regulation sets out legislative detail of a new scheme funding regime designed to protect scheme members for the long term.  The new regime is the culmination of a much longer phase of policy development. It has been built on extensive discussion, engagement, and consultation by DWP and by The Pensions Regulator (TPR), starting from a Green Paper in 2017 to more recent productive finance consultations.  The DWP consulted on the draft regulations in July 2022, which set out the requirements for defined benefit (DB) schemes when determining their funding and investment strategy and statement of strategy.  TPR also consulted on the principles that would underpin a revised DB Funding Code of Practice published in March 2020 and a draft Code published in December 2022, which provides practical guidance on how trustees can comply with scheme funding requirements.  The DWP said it has worked closely with the regulator and has sought to “explicitly anchor the flexibilities” described in the draft code after the industry expressed their concerns.  It added that it has even gone further, by making additional changes to embed more scheme-specific flexibilities.  This includes making clearer the flexibilities that were intended within the draft regulations. For example, the regulations do not constrain actual investments and even mature schemes can invest in a wide range of assets.  It also provided assurance that the investment in the sustainable growth of sponsoring employers’ businesses is a matter to consider alongside the affordability principle.  The DWP also made it explicit that open schemes can take account of new entrants and future accrual when determining when a scheme will reach significant maturity.  It also made long-term planning and implementation easier and avoiding unnecessary administrative burdens by giving TPR for example, the flexibility to ask for less detailed information in some cases, depending on the circumstances of a scheme.  Fast Track and taking risk  The DWP also noted that 70-75% of schemes meet TPR’s proposed Fast Track investment stress parameter, meaning there is potential scope for higher risk taking if the trustees believe that is appropriate and in line with their fiduciary duties.  It said that higher levels of investment risk beyond Fast Track can be taken for those taking the bespoke approach where they can justify their approach.  It added that TPR will be reconsidering its Fast Track parameters in light of its consultation responses and the changes in market conditions since their original analysis was done.  This will be published alongside their final revised DB Funding Code.  Minister for pensions, Paul Maynard, said: “As the government presses on with its productive finance agenda, I have been encouraged by the helpful engagement we have had from stakeholders.  “It was never our intention to bear down on risk-taking across the board. Rather, it was to make funding standards clearer and to promote planning for the long term. By listening to stakeholders, we’ve learned that it is easy to inadvertently drive reckless prudence and inappropriate risk aversion.”  This is why, Maynard said the DWP made changes to make the regulations “explicitly more accommodating” of appropriate risk taking where it is supportive, and to increase the scope for scheme specific flexibility.  He said: “This will support trustees in reacting to changing circumstances and investing appropriately in the best interests of their members. The Regulations will embed existing good practice, by clearly defining how the metrics set out in the Pension Schemes Act 2021 will be applied. This will enable The Pensions Regulator to intervene more effectively where things go wrong.”  Maynard added that the regulations set a “clear framework” to support sponsors and trustees in getting it right.  “In a world where most schemes are closed it is more important than ever that sponsors and trustees are working together and planning for the long term. These regulations support them in doing that,” he said.  Read the digital edition of IPE’s latest magazine","UK government confirms final DB scheme funding regulations | News | IPE Welcome to IPE.

Fast Track and taking risk The DWP also noted that 70-75% of schemes meet TPR’s proposed Fast Track investment stress parameter, meaning there is potential scope for higher risk taking if the trustees believe that is appropriate and in line with their fiduciary duties. It said that higher levels of investment risk beyond Fast Track can be taken for those taking the bespoke approach where they can justify their approach. It added that TPR will be reconsidering its Fast Track parameters in light of its consultation responses and the changes in market conditions since their original analysis was done. This will be published alongside their final revised DB Funding Code. Minister for pensions Paul Maynard Minister for pensions, Paul Maynard, said: “As the government presses on with its productive finance agenda, I have been encouraged by the helpful engagement we have had from stakeholders. “It was never our intention to bear down on risk-taking across the board. Rather, it was to make funding standards clearer and to promote planning for the long term. By listening to stakeholders, we’ve learned that it is easy to inadvertently drive reckless prudence and inappropriate risk aversion.” This is why, Maynard said the DWP made changes to make the regulations “explicitly more accommodating” of appropriate risk taking where it is supportive, and to increase the scope for scheme specific flexibility. He said: “This will support trustees in reacting to changing circumstances and investing appropriately in the best interests of their members. The Regulations will embed existing good practice, by clearly defining how the metrics set out in the Pension Schemes Act 2021 will be applied. This will enable The Pensions Regulator to intervene more effectively where things go wrong.” Maynard added that the regulations set a “clear framework” to support sponsors and trustees in getting it right. “In a world where most schemes are closed it is more important than ever that sponsors and trustees are working together and planning for the long term. These regulations support them in doing that,” he said.

3,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-framework-to-support-trainee-and-early-career-teachers,"The Department for Education has today (30 January) announced a new framework which will help ensure high quality teaching and improve pupil outcomes.  The new initial teacher training and early career framework (ITTECF) combines and updates the initial teacher training core content framework (CCF) and the early career framework (ECF). It will ensure that all new teachers receive three or more years of training underpinned by the best available evidence.  The frameworks were designed to help trainee and early career teachers succeed at the start of their teaching careers and combining them will mean teachers will get a more joined up development journey beyond initial training into the early years of their career.  Schools Minister Damian Hinds said:  Great teaching is key to securing academic success and improving pupil outcomes, which is why it is so important we continue to support teachers with high-quality, evidence-based training.  Today, we have announced a new combined framework to provide trainee and early career teachers with the knowledge and skills they need in those crucial first years in the classroom.  It’s thanks to the hard work of teachers and leaders that education standards have risen significantly since 2010. That is why we will continue to invest in competitive pay and high-quality training, improving teacher wellbeing and easing workload pressures.  Working with experts across the education sector, the framework has been updated to ensure it’s based on the latest evidence, including new and updated content on how teachers should support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), high quality oral language, and early cognitive development and children’s mental health.  Later this year, the Department for Education will be procuring updated training programmes for early career teachers (ECTs) based on this new framework. They will be designed after an evaluation of the national ECF reforms since September 2021.  The updated programmes, to be rolled out from September 2025, will be better designed to take ECTs’ learning from initial teacher training into account, provide more tailoring based on their level of development, subject and context, and streamline the training and support for mentors so they can better focus on supporting their ECTs.  The framework is a central part of the government’s teacher recruitment and retention strategy and is supported by the £130 million invested annually into the ECF.  The reforms to support trainees and ECTs builds on the government’s action to boost teacher recruitment, with £196 million invested this academic year to fund scholarships, bursaries and salary grants to help thousands of candidates through their initial teacher training.  Margaret Mulholland, ASCL SEN & Inclusion Policy Specialist said:  We must equip new teachers with the confidence and competence to know they can support every child. Whilst there are no ‘quick fixes’ for teachers or children, an Initial Teacher Training and Early Career Framework that gives more specific focus to developing the knowledge and skills to support pupils that need the most help is welcomed.  Professor Becky Francis, CEO of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), said:  Like all great professions, teaching deserves to be built upon a core body of knowledge and skills that describe best practice and are drawn from robust research. By setting out what trainee and early career teachers should be entitled to know and do, today’s updated framework is an important step to realising this.  By independently assessing and endorsing the framework, we’ve made sure the claims it makes accurately reflect the evidence from which they were drawn. Our hope is that providers will be able to translate the framework into practically relevant programmes, balancing the need to cover core content alongside the holistic needs of their participants.  Last year, the government delivered on the manifesto commitment to give every new teacher a starting salary of at least £30,000 – alongside the highest pay award for teachers in over 30 years.  In strengthening the focus on helping teachers to support children and young people with SEND, we are building on wider government reform through the SEND and AP improvement plan, which outlines plans to reform the system, ensuring every child has access to a high-quality, fulfilling education.  The SEND system is underpinned by increased investment in the high needs budget, which will have risen by over 60 percent since 2019 to 2020 to over £10.5 billion in 2024 to 2025.  Supporting teachers’ development will continue to improve pupils’ outcomes. With thanks to the hard work of teachers already, standards of education have risen sharply since 2010, with 89 percent of school rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, up from just 68 percent in 2010.  Also, pupils in England have risen up the international rankings for maths, placing England as one of the top performing countries in the western world.  This built on existing international success, with England coming fourth for primary reading proficiency, out of 43 countries that tested children of the same age in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.","New framework to support trainee and early career teachers - GOV.UK Skip to main content Cookies on GOV.UK We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

He travels to Oman on Tuesday (30 January) for the first leg of the visit. This follows regional travel last week where he met with leaders in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Qatar and Turkey.  The Houthi attacks on international shipping, which are harming regional security and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, will be a major focus of his discussions.  Last week, the UK set out new sanctions with the US against key figures within the Houthi regime’s military to disrupt their ability to carry out attacks in the Red Sea. Alongside our partners, we have issued repeated warnings through diplomatic channels to Iran and Houthi leadership to cease their attacks, and we have taken action to deter the Houthis, most recently when HMS Diamond successfully repelled a drone attack in the Red Sea on 28 January.  The Foreign Secretary will also reiterate with regional leaders the UK’s call for an immediate pause in the conflict in Gaza to allow significantly more aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable ceasefire.  The visit will be an opportunity to move forward the Foreign Secretary’s work to establish a Contact Group to be established between the US, UK, key EU, Gulf and Arab countries and Turkey, to use a pause in fighting to build momentum towards a lasting solution.  Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:  The Houthis continue to attack ships in the Red Sea, risking lives, delaying vital aid getting to the Yemeni people and disrupting global trade. And we cannot ignore the risk that the conflict in Gaza spreads, spilling over borders into other countries in the region. We will do everything we can to make sure that does not happen – escalation and instability is in nobody’s interests. In Gaza, there is an urgent need for an immediate pause to allow aid in and hostages out. We are determined to do all we can to press for a sustainable ceasefire, and are stepping up our engagement with countries in the region to make sure that happens.  The Foreign Secretary will reiterate the UK’s commitment to getting life-saving aid into Yemen, and outline the action the UK is taking to deter the Houthis targeting ships in the Red Sea.  In Oman the Foreign Secretary is expected to meet Omani Foreign Minister Badr to discuss de-escalating rising tensions across the region.","Foreign Secretary returns to Middle East to support efforts towards regional stability - GOV.UK Skip to main content Cookies on GOV.UK We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

The company's goal is to connect human brains to computers to help tackle complex neurological conditions. A number of rival firms have already implanted similar devices. ""For any company producing medical devices, the first test in humans is a significant milestone,"" said Professor Anne Vanhoestenberghe of King's College London. ""For the brain computer interface community, we must place this news in the context that whilst there are many companies working on exciting products, there are only a few other companies who have implanted their devices in humans, so Neuralink has joined a rather small group."" However, she also suggested there needed to be a note of caution as ""true success"" could only be evaluated in the long-term. ""We know Elon Musk is very adept at generating publicity for his company,"" she added. Among the other companies to make similar advances in the field is the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, which has successfully enabled a paralysed man to walk just by thinking . That was achieved by putting electronic implants on his brain and spine which wirelessly communicate thoughts to his legs and feet. Details of the breakthrough were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in May 2023. There has been no independent verification of Mr Musk's claims, nor has Neuralink provided any information about the procedure he says has taken place. BBC News has approached both Neuralink and the US's medical regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for comment. Neuralink testing Neuralink has been criticised in the past, with Reuters reporting in December 2022 that the company engaged in testing which resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,500 animals, including sheep, monkeys and pigs. In July 2023, the head of the US Department of Agriculture - which investigates animal welfare concerns - said it had not found any violations of animal research rules at the firm. However, a separate investigation by the agency is ongoing. Mr Musk's company was given permission to test the chip on humans by the FDA in May 2023. That gave the green light for the start of the six-year study during which a robot is being used to surgically place 64 flexible threads, thinner than a human hair, on to a part of the brain that controls ""movement intention"", according to Neuralink. The company says that these threads allow its experimental implant - powered by a battery that can be charged wirelessly - to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to an app that decodes how the person intends to move. ""[It] has great potential to help people with neurological disorders in future and is an excellent example of how fundamental neuroscience research is being harnessed for medical advances,"" said Professor Tara Spires-Jones, president of the British Neuroscience Association. ""However, most of these interfaces require invasive neurosurgery and are still in experimental stages thus it will likely be many years before they are commonly available."" Telepathy In another post on X, Mr Musk said Neuralink's first product would be called Telepathy. Telepathy, he said, would enable ""control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking"". ""Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs,"" he continued. Referring to the late British scientist who had motor neurone disease , he added: ""Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal."" While Mr Musk's involvement raises the profile of Neuralink, some of his rivals have a track record dating back two decades. Utah-based Blackrock Neurotech implanted its first of many brain-computer interfaces in 2004. Precision Neuroscience, formed by a Neuralink co-founder, also aims to help people with paralysis. And its implant resembles a very thin piece of tape that sits on the surface of the brain and can be implanted via a ""cranial micro-slit"", which it says is a much simpler procedure. Existing devices have also generated results. In two separate recent US scientific studies, implants were used to monitor brain activity when a person tried to speak, which could then be decoded to help them communicate.

Colour Sgt Anthony Oxley, 40, died at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in June 2016. His widow has campaigned since then for details of his death to be made public. Sally Oxley said she ""cried"" after learning last weekend from a coroner's report that police had recommended criminal charges against the driver. The BBC has contacted the US Air Force for comment. Colour Sgt Oxley, from Ryhill, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was riding a motorbike when he was involved in the collision with a Toyota Corolla driven by the US serviceman. He died later in hospital. A 2018 inquest in the UK recorded a narrative verdict, citing the officer's death had been caused by multiple head injuries. Image source, Sally Oxley Image caption, Sally Oxley has been campaigning to make the details of her husband's death public for more than seven years Mrs Oxley said she had been pushing for a new inquest after being approached in a car park outside Nicosia District Court at an earlier hearing by someone who worked for the Sovereign Base Areas (SBA) Police - the civilian police force for the British-controlled Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. An inquest was held in Nicosia in September 2023, and Mrs Oxley and over the weekend her legal team received the official translation of the coroner's conclusion. The report, seen by PA Media, named the US serviceman involved in the crash for the first time and said criminal charges against him had been recommended by the SBA Police before the US Air Force took over the investigation. The coroner said the Constable of the British Bases in Akrotiri, Michalis Vasiliou, concluded in his investigation report in 2017 there was ""sufficient evidence"" to prosecute the American for ""causing death by reckless/dangerous acts"". The report said witness statements described the driver of the car ""[taking] a sharp right turn without turning on his direction indicator to show his intention to turn"". The coroner wrote: ""The reason why no criminal charges were brought, according to the witness (Mr Vasiliou), is because the person in question was a soldier in the American Air Force and the American authorities had taken over the investigation. ""In his own report it appeared that he disagrees with a very large amount of the findings of the American report."" Image source, PA Media/Family handout Image caption, Colour Sgt Oxley had served in Iraq and Afghanistan The coroner concluded: ""There is testimony before me which demonstrates that possibly the actions, acts or omissions of third parties may have led to the death of the deceased."" Mrs Oxley, who lives in Barnsley, said: ""I've not really slept all weekend. These are the things that have been kept from us,"" she said. ""It's hard to process but I've just got to get on with it."" Mrs Oxley's legal team has now written to the UK Attorney General to request a new inquest based on the coroner's findings. She also hoped the attorney general for the Republic of Cyprus would direct a fresh criminal investigation into the crash. Mrs Oxley said: ""I'm really hopeful, I don't think I can turn back on it now. They're going to have to do something about it.""

2,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/29/bristol-stabbings-police-make-more-arrests-after-death-of-two-boys,"An investigation into the fatal stabbing of two boys with “their whole lives in front of them” has gathered pace as police said they had arrested two more men in connection with the killings.  Max Dixon, 16, and Mason Rist, 15, were attacked by a group at about 11.20pm on Saturday in Knowle West, a neighbourhood in south Bristol. They died later in hospital.  Avon and Somerset police on Monday said two men, aged 20 and 22, had been detained, while two others, a 44-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, had been arrested previously. All four remain in custody.  There was much speculation among the shocked community in Knowle West as to the motive behind the killing. Bristol commander, Supt Mark Runacres, would not comment when asked if Max and Mason were the intended victims of the attack but appeared to rule out gang involvement.  Speaking on the corner of Ilminster Avenue and Newquay Road in front of floral tributes left for the boys, Runacres said: “Bristol is a large city. And it’s described by many as a city made up of many villages. So there are people who have pride in the neighbourhoods that they come from and that’s part of their identity. But I don’t believe that this is rooted in a gang war.”  Max and Mason are understood to have been friends and both attended the Oasis Academy John Williams secondary school, a mile from the scene.  View image in fullscreen Mason Rist, left, and Max Dixon. Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA  A friend of Dixon’s, Mitchell Lyth, 22, was working at nearby Filwood Community Centre on Saturday night and saw the police helicopter above the streets around the time of the stabbing. He said he had known Dixon since he was a baby and had seen him earlier in the evening at about 7pm.  “He was a very quiet kid, very respectful. You would never ever think of him being in this sort of situation. He was always on his PlayStation 4.”  “He would never be a target, he would never get mixed up with anyone,” he said. “He’s never been in trouble.”  In a tribute on Facebook, Mason’s sister, Kayleigh, said: “My baby brother … one of a kind you are. You sleep tight. A beautiful, kind soul gone. Just taken 16 years so young and innocent oh my heart is broken.  “I really hope you know how much we love you. How much I love you. You will be missed kiddo I’ll always look out for you in every sunset, shine bright lil’ bro.”  On Monday, a regular community meeting at the Eagle House youth centre, about 100 metres from the scene, was full with residents concerned about the stabbings. Police officers attended to reassure the community.  But many exiting the meeting expressed their concern and anxieties about antisocial behaviour, gang violence and knife violence in the area.  Knowle West has a population of about 12,000 and is one of the most economically deprived neighbourhoods in the city, with a third of its working-age residents described as economically inactive.  Jonathan Gill, who owns the nearby Premier convenience store on Newquay Road, near the scene of the killings, said: “This area has a big problem with antisocial behaviour. If you look up the number of complaints, there must have been so many of them. All we hear from the police is: ‘We’re doing our best’.  “On a weekday, you’ll see 30 or 40 kids up and down the road. Residents are afraid to come out in the street. Our street is not safe at all, this has been going on for six or seven years. It’s a red alert area. Old people are scared to come to the shop at night-time because of the gangs there.”  Tributes were placed near the scene including flowers and cards. A letter had been taped to the fence behind, addressed to Mason from his “Mum, brother and sister”, paying tribute and appealing for information.  “Mason you are the best thing that happened to our family and we miss you so much it hurts. We can’t cope without you and can’t wait to see you again. You are so strong and brave.”  It added: “If anyone has information please we beg, inform police, until the people have been caught we can’t get justice.”  Runacres said more than 100 police officers were working on the investigation with support from neighbouring police forces.  He said: “Any death is awful, but the loss of Mason and Max, who had their whole lives in front of them, is particularly tragic and my heart breaks for the families who have to endure such unimaginable pain and suffering. Our thoughts remain with them during this time.”","Bristol stabbings: police make more arrests after death of two boys | UK news | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 2 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland Supt Mark Runacres issued a statement after the deaths of Mason Rist and Max Dixon in Bristol on Saturday.

Avon and Somerset police on Monday said two men, aged 20 and 22, had been detained, while two others, a 44-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, had been arrested previously. All four remain in custody. There was much speculation among the shocked community in Knowle West as to the motive behind the killing. Bristol commander, Supt Mark Runacres, would not comment when asked if Max and Mason were the intended victims of the attack but appeared to rule out gang involvement. Speaking on the corner of Ilminster Avenue and Newquay Road in front of floral tributes left for the boys, Runacres said: “Bristol is a large city. And it’s described by many as a city made up of many villages. So there are people who have pride in the neighbourhoods that they come from and that’s part of their identity. But I don’t believe that this is rooted in a gang war.” Max and Mason are understood to have been friends and both attended the Oasis Academy John Williams secondary school, a mile from the scene.

Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA A friend of Dixon’s, Mitchell Lyth, 22, was working at nearby Filwood Community Centre on Saturday night and saw the police helicopter above the streets around the time of the stabbing. He said he had known Dixon since he was a baby and had seen him earlier in the evening at about 7pm. “He was a very quiet kid, very respectful. You would never ever think of him being in this sort of situation. He was always on his PlayStation 4.” “He would never be a target, he would never get mixed up with anyone,” he said. “He’s never been in trouble.” In a tribute on Facebook, Mason’s sister, Kayleigh, said: “My baby brother … one of a kind you are. You sleep tight. A beautiful, kind soul gone. Just taken 16 years so young and innocent oh my heart is broken. “I really hope you know how much we love you. How much I love you. You will be missed kiddo I’ll always look out for you in every sunset, shine bright lil’ bro.” On Monday, a regular community meeting at the Eagle House youth centre, about 100 metres from the scene, was full with residents concerned about the stabbings. Police officers attended to reassure the community. But many exiting the meeting expressed their concern and anxieties about antisocial behaviour, gang violence and knife violence in the area. Knowle West has a population of about 12,000 and is one of the most economically deprived neighbourhoods in the city, with a third of its working-age residents described as economically inactive. Jonathan Gill, who owns the nearby Premier convenience store on Newquay Road, near the scene of the killings, said: “This area has a big problem with antisocial behaviour. If you look up the number of complaints, there must have been so many of them. All we hear from the police is: ‘We’re doing our best’. “On a weekday, you’ll see 30 or 40 kids up and down the road. Residents are afraid to come out in the street. Our street is not safe at all, this has been going on for six or seven years. It’s a red alert area. Old people are scared to come to the shop at night-time because of the gangs there.” Tributes were placed near the scene including flowers and cards. A letter had been taped to the fence behind, addressed to Mason from his “Mum, brother and sister”, paying tribute and appealing for information. “Mason you are the best thing that happened to our family and we miss you so much it hurts. We can’t cope without you and can’t wait to see you again. You are so strong and brave.” It added: “If anyone has information please we beg, inform police, until the people have been caught we can’t get justice.” Runacres said more than 100 police officers were working on the investigation with support from neighbouring police forces. He said: “Any death is awful, but the loss of Mason and Max, who had their whole lives in front of them, is particularly tragic and my heart breaks for the families who have to endure such unimaginable pain and suffering. Our thoughts remain with them during this time.” Explore more on these topics UK news news Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

9,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/30/ukrainians-uk-shocked-shortage-dentists-survey,"Ukrainians who have moved to the UK have highlighted the lack of dentists as among the most astonishing aspects of British life, according to a report on the experiences of people granted humanitarian visas.  Access to medical care is free of charge on the NHS for Ukrainians, but researchers at Birmingham University heard notably outspoken accounts about the difficulty of securing dental treatment.  The provision of dentistry services under the NHS was even negatively compared with that in Ukraine, which was a popular destination for dental care tourists before the war thanks to low charges and good availability.  One woman in her 30s, Boyka, told the researchers: “We don’t have a dentist. It’s crazy. For us, it’s, like, impossible! In Ukraine the dentist industry is huge, you know, everywhere, and because it’s everywhere you just go and it’s like £10, £8, and you can clean it, whiten it like [a] Hollywood smile!  “When you have some more problems, with£2,000 you have all-new teeth, from scratch! Here, we came: ‘Can we?’ ‘No, no, no, we are full.’”  Some British families who have taken in Ukrainian refugees have noted that their guests organise dental appointments during their visits home.  A BBC survey last year found that 90% of dental practices in the UK were refusing new adult patients. Government data indicates that unmet need for NHS dentistry in England is at a record high: 12 million people, or one in four of the adult population, are going without.  As appointments become ever harder to find, a member of the public spoken to by Healthwatch England, a committee of the Care Quality Commission, was quoted in its state of health and social care report last year as saying: “As adults, we are able to use pliers to extract our own teeth, but I feel that this shouldn’t be something that our children should have to endure.”  The Nuffield Trust, which has claimed that the NHS-funded dental service in England is in near-terminal decline, has published an analysis showing that funding for dental services was £3.1bn in 2021-22, a fall of more than £525m in real terms since 2014-15.  The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, has said she recognises that there is “more to do” to ensure access to NHS dental practices.  The Birmingham University report, Humanitarian Visas in a Hostile Environment, was based on interviews with 43 Hongkongers and Ukrainians, and is said to provide the first comparative analysis based on the testimony of those entering the UK via the government’s new suite of legal routes.  The British government has issued 184,700 visas on the British national (overseas) route for Hongkongers since the Chinese government launched a crackdown on democracy campaigners.  A total of 188,200 Ukrainians have moved to the UK under visa schemes established since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Hongkongers in the UK have to pay immigration health surcharges upfront based on the length of their visas, while the services are free of charge to Ukrainians.  The researchers wrote: “Nevertheless, people’s reported experiences were remarkably similar, and characterised by poor service standards, especially in terms of speed, and trouble with finding a dentist.”  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Access to dentistry is improving – last year 1.7 million more adults and some 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist – and we have also announced plans to increase dental training places by 40%.  “We invest £3bn each year to deliver NHS dentistry and we are also taking preventative measures, such as expanding water fluoridation schemes to reduce the number of children experiencing tooth decay.”","Ukrainians in UK shocked by shortage of dentists, survey finds | Immigration and asylum | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland Government data suggests that one in four of the adult population are going without dental care.

Britain's economic prospects and the Conservative Party's record during its time in office since 2010 are frequent topics of political debate with a national election expected in the second half of this year.  Overall the IMF forecasts - part of a broader global update - show British gross domestic product growth picking up from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.6% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025, as falling energy prices lower inflation, boosting disposable incomes and allowing the Bank of England to cut rates in the second half of 2024.  The IMF's latest estimate for 2025 is 0.4 percentage points below a previous estimate made in October, reflecting ""reduced scope for growth to catch up in light of recent upward statistical revisions to the level of output through the pandemic period.""  The growth in 2023 and 2024 remains weak by historic standards and only Germany, which was also hit hard by a surge in European gas prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, is expected to perform worse.  In 2025, British growth is forecast to be just below the average in both the euro zone and among advanced economies.  Official figures published on September 29 - too late for inclusion in October's IMF forecast - showed Britain's economy in June 2023 was 1.8% larger than before the Covid-19 pandemic, not 0.2% smaller as calculated in mid-August.  In November, Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility forecast 0.7% economic growth for 2024 and 1.4% for 2025.  Finance minister Jeremy Hunt welcomed the latest IMF forecast that growth would pick up, which he partly attributed to his recent cuts to business and employee taxation.  ""It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth,"" he said.  The opposition Labour Party has highlighted the fall in living standards caused by recent high inflation as well as weak wage growth before the pandemic.","IMF cuts UK's growth forecast for next year Your browser does not support Javascript.

Posted at 19:20 30 Jan 19:20 30 Jan 'Anti-tourism agenda' Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders accuses the Welsh government of having an ""anti-tourism agenda"" and calls for extending development rights for temporary campsites by increasing the number of days they are allowed from 28 to 60. The first minister replies, ""I understand the points that the member has made and the sector has made about if it had more days in which it was able to open caravan parks without planning permission, that would be of advantage to some people in the industry. But we also know that there have been complaints in the past of those pop-up caravan sites creating traffic that is unregulated, that there is smoke that affects people who live nearby, there is noise from people—who are, after all, coming on holiday to enjoy themselves, and they’re very close sometimes to where people live their lives. So, what the minister will be doing will be to be weighing up those different considerations. If it is possible to extend the number of days that caravan parks can pop up without planning permission, then there will have to be safeguards for people who live nearby as well.""

Posted at 19:05 30 Jan 19:05 30 Jan Homelessness BBC Copyright: BBC Heledd Fychan Image caption: Heledd Fychan Plaid Cymru’s Heledd Fychan raises concerns that individuals facing homelessness are currently being housed in an old Toys R Us store in Cardiff Bay. She says ""emergency shelter is needed immediately for anyone who is facing homelessness, but the conditions in which vulnerable people are being housed are very concerning to me and concerning to a number of staff who are supporting service users"". The first minister replies ""in the run-up to Christmas, Cardiff becomes a magnet for people who come to the city, who find that they have nowhere to live, and turn to the local authority to assist them. ""At the same time, Cardiff, above any other part of Wales, is dealing with the consequences of the Home Office's decision to speed up decision-making in the asylum system—a good thing in itself, but with many, many people being ejected from the accommodation that they previously able to enjoy, with nowhere to go, but to the homelessness services of the local authority. ""Those two things came together before Christmas in a way that was incredibly difficult for the local authority to find a way to respond. It has used the Toys R Us site. It says that it will have stopped using that site in April of this year because it has other, more suitable, accommodation coming on stream.""

Posted at 18:57 30 Jan 18:57 30 Jan Wales Air Ambulance bases BBC Copyright: BBC Rhun ap Iorwerth Image caption: Rhun ap Iorwerth Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth expresses concerns that two Wales Air Ambulance bases could be set to shut, according to a review into the service. The review shortlists the closure of sites in Welshpool in Powys, and Caernarfon in Gwynedd, with the emergency helicopters relocated to north-east Wales. Rhun ap Iorwerth says ""I believe those clinicians who fear that that will put mid and north-west Wales under a disadvantage and indeed will put lives at risk"". He asks, ""the review of air ambulance provision is being conducted by the Emergency Ambulance Services Committee which is a joint committee between the seven health boards. So, the Welsh government has an ability to influence and to intervene. Is the first minister willing to recognise the real concerns and to take the necessary steps to safeguard both sites so that the Wales Air Ambulance does serve all parts of this country equally?"" Mr Drakeford replies, ""I recognise the concerns of local people about the future of the service but this happens wherever there is reorganisation. And that's what's happened here. The people who are responsible for the service have been out to consult with local people and have spoken to people the length and breadth of Wales, because what they are suggesting is that nobody loses out on the service that they currently receive, but that there's an opportunity for far more people to receive the service who can't currently receive it.""

Posted at 18:49 30 Jan 18:49 30 Jan Welsh Rugby Union Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, asks for the first minister's assessment of what the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has done after a report found sexism and racism was not properly challenged . It was produced in the wake of a BBC Wales documentary that showed a former boss at Welsh women's rugby said she considered suicide because of the organisation's culture. The first minister replies ""a very good start has been made. But there's a lot of work that will still need to be carried out to make sure that those thoroughgoing cultural issues, which we know are deeply embedded in organisations - we've seen it in other organisations in recent times, haven't we, in the fire and rescue service, for example, in south Wales. Those cultures take hold and they are hard to shift. I think the WRU has made a good start."" Mr Davies also points out that the Welsh Rugby Union has asked Welsh ministers for three years of ""breathing space"" on interest payments from an £18m Covid recovery loan. The Welsh government should make sure “there isn’t that burden placed on the grassroots game within Wales, should the WRU have to make cutbacks,” says Mr Davies. The first minister replies the WRU ""were free agents in taking up that loan. And while we are always prepared and have been prepared to talk to the union about whether the loan can be restructured, whether there are other ways in which we can assist, in the end, this was a commercially determined loan, with conditions inherited from the UK coronavirus assistance, and entered into freely by the WRU itself.""

Posted at 18:36 30 Jan 18:36 30 Jan Local government budgets Llywydd Elin Jones conducts a ballot to determine the names of members who may table questions to the first minister and Welsh ministers. Each member may enter their name into a ballot. His Labour colleague Jayne Bryant asks what is the Welsh government doing to support local government to balance their budgets. Mr Drakeford says there is uncertainty whether Wales will get an extra £25m for public services off the back of a boost for English councils aimed at tackling a cash crisis. An additional £500m was announced for social care for councils in England last week. The first minister says, ""this just illustrates the unfairness of the way that funding in the United Kingdom is organised. Local government in England will now know the settlement that it has received from the UK government. We will have to wait until the spring budget to see whether that £25 million really does arrive in Wales, or whether it's offset by other changes in our budget, which could actually mean, not that we're £25 million better off, but that we're worse off than we currently believe we will be. And that would not be the first time at all that that has happened."" Welsh public services get extra money when the UK government boosts funding to services in England, like health and councils, which are run from Cardiff in Wales. In the local government settlement Newport council saw the largest budget increase at 4.7%, while Conwy and Gwynedd got the worst at 2%.

6,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/29/uk-france-small-boats-pact-doubling-drownings-directly-linked,"The most recent illegal migration pact between the UK and France is “directly linked” to a doubling of the number of Channel drownings in the last year, a report has found.  The increased police presence on French beaches – along with more dinghies being stopped from reaching the coast – is leading to more dangerous overcrowding and chaotic attempts to board the boats, the paper said.  The lives lost in 2023 – when the deal was signed – were close to the French shore and to police patrols on the beaches, in contrast to earlier Channel drownings such as the mass drowning on 24 November 2021, where at least 27 people lost their lives after their boat got into difficulty in the middle of the Channel.  “We directly link the recent increase in the number of deadly incidents to the agreement between the British and French governments to Stop The Boats,” the report states.  It adds that the increased police presence and their attacks on some of the migrants trying to cross “create panicked and dangerous situations in which dinghies launch before they are fully inflated”. This scenario can increase the risk of drowning in shallow water.  The paper, named the Deadly Consequences of the New Deal to Stop the Boats, condemns what it describes as increased police violence as the most visible consequence of last year’s deal.  The report compares data in the year before the March 2023 deal with last year’s data after the deal was signed.  The data was analysed by the organisation Alarmphone, which operates an emergency helpline for migrants crossing the seas who get into distress, and passes on location and other information to rescue services.  In 2022, six lives were lost at sea in three separate incidents. In 2023, at least 13 lives were lost in six separate incidents.  The most recent incident was on 14 January this year where five people lost their lives near the beach of Wimereux, north of Boulogne-sur-Mer, as more than 70 people tried to board a dinghy.  The BBC reported that two of those who drowned were Obada Abd Rabbo, 14, and his older brother, Ayser, 24, who lost their lives a few metres from the French coast when people rushed into the sea to try to board the dinghy.  Crossings reduced by a third in 2023 compared with 2022. But there are indications more migrants are turning to lorries and other methods of transport to reach the UK as the clampdown on sea crossings increases.  Incidents last year in which people lost their lives close to the French shore include:  12 August 2023: six Afghan men drowned in an overloaded dinghy which got intro trouble close to the French shore  26 September 2023: Eritrean woman, 24, died in Blériot-Plage after being asphyxiated in a crush of 80 people trying to board one dinghy  22 November 2023: three people drowned close to Équihen-Plage as the dinghy collapsed close to the shore. Fifty-seven survivors returned to the beach.  The report concludes that the UK/French deal has further destabilised an already dangerous situation while police are still unable to prevent most crossings on a busy day. It identifies “victim blaming” of those trying to cross by politicians.  A Home Office spokesperson said: “Fatal incidents in the Channel are the result of dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys in unseaworthy craft, facilitated by criminals in the pursuit of profit.  “Asylum seekers should seek protection in the first country where it is reasonable for them to do so and we continue to take robust action to crackdown on criminal gangs, deter migrants from making dangerous crossings and intercept vessels.”  The French interior ministry was approached for comment.","UK and France’s small boats pact and doubling in drownings ‘directly linked’ | Immigration and asylum | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development More A French police officer on the beach as police work to prevent the departure of an inflatable boat carrying migrants attempting to illegally cross the Channel to reach Britain in July 2023.

The lives lost in 2023 – when the deal was signed – were close to the French shore and to police patrols on the beaches, in contrast to earlier Channel drownings such as the mass drowning on 24 November 2021, where at least 27 people lost their lives after their boat got into difficulty in the middle of the Channel. “We directly link the recent increase in the number of deadly incidents to the agreement between the British and French governments to Stop The Boats,” the report states. It adds that the increased police presence and their attacks on some of the migrants trying to cross “create panicked and dangerous situations in which dinghies launch before they are fully inflated”. This scenario can increase the risk of drowning in shallow water. The paper, named the Deadly Consequences of the New Deal to Stop the Boats, condemns what it describes as increased police violence as the most visible consequence of last year’s deal. The report compares data in the year before the March 2023 deal with last year’s data after the deal was signed. The data was analysed by the organisation Alarmphone, which operates an emergency helpline for migrants crossing the seas who get into distress, and passes on location and other information to rescue services. In 2022, six lives were lost at sea in three separate incidents. In 2023, at least 13 lives were lost in six separate incidents. The most recent incident was on 14 January this year where five people lost their lives near the beach of Wimereux, north of Boulogne-sur-Mer, as more than 70 people tried to board a dinghy. The BBC reported that two of those who drowned were Obada Abd Rabbo, 14, and his older brother, Ayser, 24, who lost their lives a few metres from the French coast when people rushed into the sea to try to board the dinghy. Crossings reduced by a third in 2023 compared with 2022. But there are indications more migrants are turning to lorries and other methods of transport to reach the UK as the clampdown on sea crossings increases. Incidents last year in which people lost their lives close to the French shore include: 12 August 2023: six Afghan men drowned in an overloaded dinghy which got intro trouble close to the French shore 26 September 2023: Eritrean woman, 24, died in Blériot-Plage after being asphyxiated in a crush of 80 people trying to board one dinghy 22 November 2023: three people drowned close to Équihen-Plage as the dinghy collapsed close to the shore. Fifty-seven survivors returned to the beach. The report concludes that the UK/French deal has further destabilised an already dangerous situation while police are still unable to prevent most crossings on a busy day. It identifies “victim blaming” of those trying to cross by politicians. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Fatal incidents in the Channel are the result of dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys in unseaworthy craft, facilitated by criminals in the pursuit of profit. “Asylum seekers should seek protection in the first country where it is reasonable for them to do so and we continue to take robust action to crackdown on criminal gangs, deter migrants from making dangerous crossings and intercept vessels.” The French interior ministry was approached for comment.

Ireland N. Ireland Politics DUP officers 'have taken a decision' on the deal to restore power sharing Published 23 hours ago comments Comments Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Press Eye Image caption, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson left his party's HQ at Dundela on Monday evening to brief DUP executive members at Larchfield Estate By Enda McClafferty BBC News NI political editor DUP officers have already taken a decision on the deal aimed at restoring power sharing, the BBC understands. It is believed they met at the end of last week, but it is not clear if there was a vote taken among the 12 officers. Though it is understood Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had the support of the majority of officers ahead of the meeting. The party leader is was expected to tell executive members about the decision taken by the party officers. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was providing a ""detailed update"" on the possible deal to restore power-sharing government at Stormont on Monday evening at a meeting held at Larchfield Estate outside Lisburn. If there is support for a return to power sharing then it is likely to be conditional on the government tabling any legislation promised in the deal. The DUP collapsed the executive nearly two years ago in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements. The party has been in talks with the UK government seeking changes to the arrangements which were agreed in the UK-EU Windsor Framework deal. Sir Jeffrey arrived at the party's headquarters in Dundela Avenue in Belfast earlier, before travelling to Monday night's meeting at Larchfield Estate. He did not make any comment as he entered the meeting. An email invitation for Monday night's meeting was leaked on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday evening. Details of deal offered to DUP beginning to emerge The 12 DUP members key to Stormont's return Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's leadership moment The DUP has more than 120 executive members, including MLAs, party officers and others. In the email sent to those members, the party's chief executive wrote: ""I apologise for the short notice of this meeting but due to circumstances beyond our control the officers... have determined to waive the normal notice period for calling a meeting."" Executive members were also asked not to discuss details of the meeting with the media. It was supposed to be a secret meeting in a secure location. Members of the DUP Executive weren't even told the venue until a few hours before such was the party's desire to conduct its business away from the prying eyes of the media. In reality it turned into a nightmare with the loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson tweeting out what he claimed were detailed updates from inside Larchfield Estate. At one point he claimed the meeting had been halted and descended into ""mayhem"" with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying texts were being sent allowing him to give a ""blow by blow"" account. He tweeted that Sir Jeffrey had brought the PSNI in to ""try to block phone signals""; the PSNI said it had ""no involvement in this"". But if the leaks are accurate its clear Sir Jeffrey believes the time for negotiating is over although at least one person inside the room is determined to make his job even more difficult. A 'DUP/Sinn Féin carve-up'? On Monday, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told Good Morning Ulster he believed the DUP would make a decision later, at least internally, but they will wait to see what the government does. ""Tonight unelected representatives of the DUP are going to be briefed, in detail about the deal, and here I am as a leader of a party entitled to go into the executive, though who has still not received any briefing about what it involves, and I am hearing that Sinn Féin also understands what the deal involves. ""It looks like there will be a DUP/Sinn Féin carve-up in any executive."" Image source, Reuters/CLODAGH KILCOYNE Image caption, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill has repeatedly called on the DUP to return to power sharing at Stormont DUP peer and former speaker of the assembly Lord Hay told the programme that the meeting is ""very simply to update grassroot members by the party leader of where we're at with the talks with the government"". He added: ""The real traitors within unionism are people who continually brief against the party, even within the party, and all they're doing is damaging unionism for now and the future."" 'Only one place to go' Alliance assembly member Nuala McAllister said she was hopeful that the DUP would make the ""right decision for everyone in Northern Ireland"", and that she detected a shift in tone from the party. ""We've been running out of time for a long time now and really there is only one place to go and that's for the DUP to come back in to an executive and an assembly,"" she said. Image caption, Nuala McAllister's Alliance party is now Stormont's third biggest party, having won 17 seats in the 2022 election Sinn Féin assembly member Conor Murphy said the ""time for prevarication is over"" as he reiterated calls for the DUP to return to Stormont power-sharing. He accused the DUP of ""internal party navel-gazing"" while public services in Northern Ireland have been facing ""enormous challenges"" during the absence of an executive. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the DUP meeting was ""clearly significant"". ""This is a moment of decision,"" he added. What is likely to be in the deal? I have not seen the deal offered to the DUP and I haven't been briefed on it, but what seems to be central to the government's offer is that it will opt to limit the UK's active divergence from EU rules on traded goods where that would cause difficulties for Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland stayed within the EU single market for goods after Brexit, so the EU now requires controls on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in case non-EU approved products end up in its territory. Image source, Michael Cooper/Getty Images Image caption, The most significant part of the deal will be its implications for how UK goods are imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland The Daily Telegraph reported that limiting active divergence would mean new UK laws would have to be screened in relation to EU rules to ensure they do not have any significant adverse impact on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. So, will the UK actively converge on any EU rule changes for the same purpose? To me, that is the big unanswered question. Other aspects of the deal are mooted to include: An east-west political body similar to the North South Ministerial Council , to discuss mutual interests between Northern Ireland and Great Britain A business organisation similar to InterTrade Ireland but focused on boosting trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain The Windsor Framework's green lane being re-named the UK internal market lane New legal guarantees of access for Northern Ireland traders selling to Great Britain There will still be differences in how trade is conducted in Northern Ireland, compared to other parts of the UK, but can that be minimised to an extent that would be acceptable to DUP members? We'll wait and see. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, Baroness Kate Hoey, Ben Habib and Jamie Bryson have jointly published a paper setting out their opposition to any deal. They warned the DUP against ""implementing the union-dismantling protocol"" which they say the party once opposed. In a statement, they said: ""The perversion and constitutional obscenity of a partitioning border in the Irish Sea would be given permanency through its acceptance by the DUP, if they return to Stormont now."" Image source, PA Media Image caption, TUV leader Jim Allister is among those to publish a paper setting out opposition to any deal Speaking at Stormont on Monday, Mr Allister said that ""if the DUP decides to return to Stormont, it is deciding to accept and take ownership of the protocol"". He added that if the Irish Sea border remained, ""it would be a point of no return because that would be accepting that never again would Northern Ireland be a full part of the UK"". 'Win-win' The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin says it is clear the current offer for Northern Ireland is a win-win. Mr Martin said he wished to give the DUP time and space to hold their meeting this evening before pre-empting any outcome. ""Well, I think everybody knows I'd like to see the restoration of the executive and the assembly. That said, less is more today,"" he said. ""I respect the fact that there are meetings and internal discussions, and discussions with UK Government on an ongoing basis for the last number of months."" Mr Martin added that ""what has been agreed over time puts Northern Ireland in a very strong position to grow economically"". Last week, the deadline for restoring devolution was extended to 8 February ; if there is no executive in place by then, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris will be under a legal duty to call an election. It is understood he may instead put new governance arrangements in place including a greater role for London.

During the trial, the same route would cost commuters £3.60. By  Dylan Donnelly, news reporter Sunday 28 January 2024 09:08, UK Image: Pic: Reuters Why you can trust Sky News London's mayor has announced a £24m plan to slash peak time train fares on Fridays. Sadiq Khan asked Transport for London (TfL) to trial off-peak fares all day on Fridays for three months in a bid to increase passenger numbers and boost the economy. While TfL figures show midweek travel on the Tube is at 85% of pre-Covid levels, the figure for Fridays is just 73%. On TfL and mainline rail services in London , peak fares apply on weekdays between 6.30am and 9.30am and between 4pm and 7pm. Commuting by Tube from Zone 6 into Zone 1 at peak times costs £5.60 per journey. During the trial, the same route would cost commuters £3.60. Mr Khan said he wants ""everyone to be able to make the most all week of living or working in London"".

""That's why I've asked TfL to trial off-peak fares on Fridays, and I encourage Londoners to get involved. Advertisement ""A trial will help us to see if it's an effective way of increasing ridership and giving a welcome boost to businesses as we continue to build a better, fairer, more prosperous London for everyone."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UKHospitality, added: ""There's no doubt that Fridays have suffered as a result of changes to working patterns since the pandemic, and hospitality businesses have felt that loss of commuter trade. ""Responding to these challenges with innovative trials like off-peak Fridays is exactly the type of flexible approach needed to boost journey numbers and stimulate footfall in our venues.""

TfL will also receive £250m in extra funding from the government, which will be invested into new projects Rail minister Huw Merriman said the £250m deal would have ""a tangible, positive impact, not just for people travelling in and around the capital, but also the millions who visit every year"". TfL welcomed the funding, saying it was ""grateful for the support,"" but it still claimed the network was being hit by a ""continuing shortfall in funding"" from Whitehall to pay for its capital investment programme, which replaces old trains and delivers new signalling among other projects.

It's hope that today marks the beginning of the end of two years of political deadlock at Stormont. The DUP has struck a deal with the UK government that should allow power-sharing to be restored in Northern Ireland, with the country set for its first nationalist first minister in Sinn Fein's. Michelle O'Neill. Here are some of the key dates that got us to where we are today: 21:40:01 In pictures: Cleverly meets French counterpart in Paris Home Secretary James Cleverly today met with his French counterpart Gérald Darmanin for talks in in Paris. We don't yet have details of what they discussed - but we have the pictures below: 21:18:01 Northern Ireland Assembly: What is power-sharing and why is the system used? Northern Ireland has a different type of governance from the rest of the UK in response to decades of conflict within the country. The country operates under a power-sharing model devised as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it requires a fine balancing act to make it work. Here, Sky News takes a look at how the system works, why it is needed, and how well it has worked since its inception: 20:54:01 Northern Ireland, cheese and fish: Why it's an important week in life after Brexit As we've been reporting here all day, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has agreed a deal to restore power-sharing to Northern Ireland, subject to legislation by the UK government. The DUP walked out nearly two years ago over post-Brexit trade arrangements that created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There's been a big impact on public services and a new power-sharing government is being promised over £3bn to spend on them. And new post Brexit border controls coming in from 31 January could result in higher prices and delays in fresh goods coming in from the EU. On the Sky News Daily with Niall Paterson, our senior Ireland correspondent David Blevins takes us through the significance of the DUP's agreement. Plus, business correspondent Paul Kelso explains the latest warnings on trade with Patricia Michelson, founder of London cheese chain La Fromagerie, which has been importing from Europe for 40 years. 20:39:32 Fire safety test urged for 'dangerous' batteries in e-cycles and e-scooters Additional fire safety tests must be brought in for ""dangerous"" lithium-ion batteries in e-cycles and e-scooters, ministers have been told. Fires caused by these batteries have surged, with firefighters in London alone attending more than 150 caused by e-bikes and e-scooters in 2023. A new call for improved safety came today as members of the House of Lords debated the Pedicabs (London) Bill, which provides for the regulation of pedicabs in London. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Randerson said: ""Already, 13 people have died as a result of lithium-ion battery fires. One person died on New Year's Day this year. ""There have also been many more people very badly injured and there has been a massive cost of the destruction of property."" She added: ""This is an issue based on clear evidence of danger and risk and repeated fires, which come when something has gone wrong, when corners have been cut in the manufacturing process."" Tory peer Lord Moylan added: ""I find it very strange that in this modern world it seems impossible to rely on the safety of something as straight-forward as a battery."" The Pedicabs (London) Bill has now passed its report stage in the Lords, and after its third reading will be sent to the Commons for MPs' scrutiny. 20:17:54 The latest from the Sky News live poll tracker The surge of Reform UK continues as the party overtakes the Liberal Democrats in the polls for the first time. The Sky News live poll tracker - collated and updated by our Data and Forensics team - aggregates various surveys to indicate how voters feel about different political parties. Labour is still sitting comfortably on a roughly 19-point lead, averaging at 44.1% in the polls, and the Tories on 24.7%. In third is Reform UK on 10.4%, followed by the Lib Dems on 9.9%, the Greens on 6.3%, and the SNP on 3.1%. See the latest update below - and you can read more about the methodology behind the tracker here . 20:01:29 Who else is 'plotting' against PM? Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns has just claimed that ""the left"" of the Conservative Party are ""plotting"" against Rishi Sunak ""as well"". She says: ""I'm hearing that on good authority. ""And let's face it, Kemi was in a group who were also trying to oust Boris at the time, WhatsApps got leaked where she was saying 'Come on, resign' to all the other ministers. ""So I'm not surprised to hear that, to be honest with you."" Would Andrea like to see Kemi Badenoch rise through the ranks? ""Oh God no, in parliament she's known as a great pretender because if you look at her voting record it's not like the rhetoric."" That brings tonight's Politics Hub With Sophy Ridge to a close.

New offensive? The head of Ukrainian military intelligence said he expected Russia's offensive on the eastern front to fizzle out by early spring, when it would then be Ukraine's ""move"". 18:35:01 Ukrainian region becomes first to remove all Soviet monuments Lviv has become Ukraine's first region to remove all its Soviet-era monuments, its governor has announced. The move is part a broader wartime push to erase all traces of Russian rule. Maksym Kozytskyi said activists and residents have removed 312 monuments in his western region, which borders Poland. ""Not a kopek from the regional budget was spent on toppling these 'idols',"" he said. Thousands of streets and settlements in Ukraine, which declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, have been renamed in recent years as part of the drive. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, proposed renaming the centrally located Pushkin Street, a nod to the Russian author, after prominent a Ukrainian philosopher. Last month, authorities in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv dismantled a statue of a Red Army commander from a central boulevard. 18:05:01 Ukrainian intelligence chief hints at new offensive after Russia's fizzles out in spring The head of Ukrainian military intelligence says he expects Russia's offensive on the eastern front to fizzle out by early spring. Once Moscow's attacks have been exhausted, it will be Ukraine's turn to move, said Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's GUR agency, on national TV. Russia has stepped up attacks in the northeast since last autumn, seeking to encircle bastions such as the town of Avdiivka. The Ukrainian military said it was in ""active defence"" while carrying out counterattacks. ""[Russia's] offensive is still ongoing. Somewhere in early spring, it will be exhausted completely,"" Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency GUR, said on national TV. He played down the Russian forces' gains, saying they had only achieved ""a few advances across some fields"" and near Avdiivka. ""Now it's the enemy's move. It will end, and I think ours will start,"" he added. 17:20:01 Russia increases air defence production to tackle 'key issues' Russia is increasing production of air defence missiles to address ""key issues"", defence minister Sergei Shoigu has announced. The defence ministry released footage of his speech after Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian cities and energy infrastructure. ""There has been a significant increase in the volume of production. We have more than doubled production of the missiles we need for air defence,"" he said while visiting a missile factory. ""But there are some key issues we need to address and we need to address them quite vigorously. There is the question of engines, and there is the question of the establishment of launcher production."" Russian officials have in recent months indicated rapid improvements in the country's military industrial capacity aimed at bolstering Russia's military in its deadlocked campaign against Ukraine. 16:35:01 Dissident Russian rock band could be deported home after arrest in Thailand A Russian anti-war rock band could be deported home from Thailand after being arrested for working without a permit, officials have said. There are fears the self-exiled band Bi-2 could face harsh punishment if they are returned to Moscow, after previously condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Band members were arrested after they played a gig in Phuket on 24 January, according to an online petition against their deportation. ""This usually results in deportation to their country of origin but there is some discretion [about the destination],"" said Kriangkrai Ariyaying, the superintendent of Phuket's Immigration Bureau. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand for Human Rights Watch, said the musicians would ""likely face harsh prosecution and other grave dangers"" if they were sent back to Russia due to their dissident status. ""This case is a litmus test of Thailand's compliance with fundamental human rights principles,"" he said. A petition calling for the band not to be deported has garnered more than 500 signatures so far. 15:54:21 Zelenskyy 'preparing to replace top Ukrainian commander' after rumours swirl Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to replace top Ukrainian commander General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, according to a report, after months of reported conflict between the pair. Rumours had swirled online yesterday that General Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, had either been dismissed or stepped down from his role. Mr Zelenskyy's office denied the reports. However, the Financial Times is now reporting that the Ukrainian president is preparing to replace General Zaluzhnyi in what would be the most significant shake-up of military command since Russia's invasion nearly two years ago. According to the FT, which cited four people familiar with the matter, Mr Zelenskyy yesterday offered the general a new role, but he refused. 15:25:01 Zelenskyy: Russia launches nearly 1,000 drones and missiles in a month Russia has launched more than 330 missiles and roughly 600 drones at Ukraine since the year began, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. In a plea to partners, the Ukrainian president reiterated calls for a ""strong air shield"" against Russian attacks. ""We must ensure Ukraine's control over its skies, which is also critical to ensuring security on the ground - from frontline positions to hospitals and schools in the rear,"" he said. ""Air defence and electronic warfare are our top priorities. Russian terror must be defeated - this is achievable."" 14:33:34 Macron demands clear measures on Ukraine imports as farmer protests grip France Emmanuel Macron says France is seeking clear measures on imports coming from Ukraine as farmers protest en masse in France and across Europe. Farmers have set up roadblocks over a series of long-standing grievances, including low wages, burdensome regulations and fuel taxes. Some argue that cheap grain imports from Ukraine to the EU have created unfair competition. ""We have asked to have clear measures on imports from Ukraine because today we have things in volume and quality that are destabilising the European market, whether it comes to chickens or cereals,"" Mr Macron said during a state visit to Sweden. 14:14:49 Lavrov dismisses 'absurd' suggestions Russia could invade other nations Russia's foreign minister has said it is ""absurd"" to suggest Russia could invade other nations after Ukraine, according to a state media report. The TASS news agency cited comments made by Sergei Lavrov at a round table with Kremlin-allied heads of diplomatic missions today. He referred to a previous suggestion that Ukraine was a ""defensive rampart"" for Europe in front of Russia, as well as suggestions in recent weeks that the Baltics, Sweden and Finland could be next in line after its invasion of Ukraine. Joe Biden has also recently said Russia could attack NATO if it claims victory in the Ukraine war - with Mr Lavrov appearing to reference this also. ""The absurdity of such statements is clear to everyone, to anyone who understands history in the slightest degree and understands the goals that we openly, without hiding, announced regarding the special military operation in Ukraine,"" Mr Lavrov reportedly told the round table. He said the aim of the war was ""eliminating historical injustice"" and in turn accused the US of leading NATO in threatening Russia's security. 13:26:01 'PoWs' on crashed plane could have been used as 'human shields', Ukraine says Russia has shown ""no readiness"" to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian prisoners allegedly on board a plane that crashed in Belgorod last week, Ukraine has said. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov told broadcaster Suspilne that Kyiv had no evidence confirming the presence of prisoners of war on board the Russian Il-76 aircraft that came down on 24 January. ""That our prisoners were there is Russia's statement, and for now we can only analyse from their words,"" he said. ""At the moment, there is no readiness to transfer the bodies from that side.

'Inadequate training': Russia accidentally bombed its own territory for the fourth time in a month, the UK defence ministry said. Warehouse blaze: A fire erupted at a warehouse in the Kyiv region after a Russian attack, Ukraine's national police service said. Dissident relocated: A Russian-British dissident who vanished from the Siberian penal colony where he was being held has reportedly been transferred to another site in region. Command shake-up: The Ukrainian president was preparing to replace General Zaluzhnyi in what would be the most significant change to military command since Russia's invasion, reported the Financial Times. New offensive? The head of Ukrainian military intelligence said he expected Russia's offensive on the eastern front to fizzle out by early spring, when it would then be Ukraine's ""move"". 18:35:01 Ukrainian region becomes first to remove all Soviet monuments Lviv has become Ukraine's first region to remove all its Soviet-era monuments, its governor has announced. The move is part a broader wartime push to erase all traces of Russian rule. Maksym Kozytskyi said activists and residents have removed 312 monuments in his western region, which borders Poland. ""Not a kopek from the regional budget was spent on toppling these 'idols',"" he said. Thousands of streets and settlements in Ukraine, which declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, have been renamed in recent years as part of the drive. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, proposed renaming the centrally located Pushkin Street, a nod to the Russian author, after prominent a Ukrainian philosopher. Last month, authorities in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv dismantled a statue of a Red Army commander from a central boulevard. 18:05:01 Ukrainian intelligence chief hints at new offensive after Russia's fizzles out in spring The head of Ukrainian military intelligence says he expects Russia's offensive on the eastern front to fizzle out by early spring. Once Moscow's attacks have been exhausted, it will be Ukraine's turn to move, said Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's GUR agency, on national TV. Russia has stepped up attacks in the northeast since last autumn, seeking to encircle bastions such as the town of Avdiivka. The Ukrainian military said it was in ""active defence"" while carrying out counterattacks. ""[Russia's] offensive is still ongoing. Somewhere in early spring, it will be exhausted completely,"" Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency GUR, said on national TV. He played down the Russian forces' gains, saying they had only achieved ""a few advances across some fields"" and near Avdiivka. ""Now it's the enemy's move. It will end, and I think ours will start,"" he added. 17:20:01 Russia increases air defence production to tackle 'key issues' Russia is increasing production of air defence missiles to address ""key issues"", defence minister Sergei Shoigu has announced. The defence ministry released footage of his speech after Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian cities and energy infrastructure. ""There has been a significant increase in the volume of production. We have more than doubled production of the missiles we need for air defence,"" he said while visiting a missile factory. ""But there are some key issues we need to address and we need to address them quite vigorously. There is the question of engines, and there is the question of the establishment of launcher production."" Russian officials have in recent months indicated rapid improvements in the country's military industrial capacity aimed at bolstering Russia's military in its deadlocked campaign against Ukraine. 16:35:01 Dissident Russian rock band could be deported home after arrest in Thailand A Russian anti-war rock band could be deported home from Thailand after being arrested for working without a permit, officials have said. There are fears the self-exiled band Bi-2 could face harsh punishment if they are returned to Moscow, after previously condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Band members were arrested after they played a gig in Phuket on 24 January, according to an online petition against their deportation. ""This usually results in deportation to their country of origin but there is some discretion [about the destination],"" said Kriangkrai Ariyaying, the superintendent of Phuket's Immigration Bureau. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand for Human Rights Watch, said the musicians would ""likely face harsh prosecution and other grave dangers"" if they were sent back to Russia due to their dissident status. ""This case is a litmus test of Thailand's compliance with fundamental human rights principles,"" he said. A petition calling for the band not to be deported has garnered more than 500 signatures so far. 15:54:21 Zelenskyy 'preparing to replace top Ukrainian commander' after rumours swirl Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to replace top Ukrainian commander General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, according to a report, after months of reported conflict between the pair. Rumours had swirled online yesterday that General Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, had either been dismissed or stepped down from his role. Mr Zelenskyy's office denied the reports. However, the Financial Times is now reporting that the Ukrainian president is preparing to replace General Zaluzhnyi in what would be the most significant shake-up of military command since Russia's invasion nearly two years ago. According to the FT, which cited four people familiar with the matter, Mr Zelenskyy yesterday offered the general a new role, but he refused. 15:25:01 Zelenskyy: Russia launches nearly 1,000 drones and missiles in a month Russia has launched more than 330 missiles and roughly 600 drones at Ukraine since the year began, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. In a plea to partners, the Ukrainian president reiterated calls for a ""strong air shield"" against Russian attacks. ""We must ensure Ukraine's control over its skies, which is also critical to ensuring security on the ground - from frontline positions to hospitals and schools in the rear,"" he said. ""Air defence and electronic warfare are our top priorities. Russian terror must be defeated - this is achievable."" 14:33:34 Macron demands clear measures on Ukraine imports as farmer protests grip France Emmanuel Macron says France is seeking clear measures on imports coming from Ukraine as farmers protest en masse in France and across Europe. Farmers have set up roadblocks over a series of long-standing grievances, including low wages, burdensome regulations and fuel taxes. Some argue that cheap grain imports from Ukraine to the EU have created unfair competition. ""We have asked to have clear measures on imports from Ukraine because today we have things in volume and quality that are destabilising the European market, whether it comes to chickens or cereals,"" Mr Macron said during a state visit to Sweden. 14:14:49 Lavrov dismisses 'absurd' suggestions Russia could invade other nations Russia's foreign minister has said it is ""absurd"" to suggest Russia could invade other nations after Ukraine, according to a state media report. The TASS news agency cited comments made by Sergei Lavrov at a round table with Kremlin-allied heads of diplomatic missions today. He referred to a previous suggestion that Ukraine was a ""defensive rampart"" for Europe in front of Russia, as well as suggestions in recent weeks that the Baltics, Sweden and Finland could be next in line after its invasion of Ukraine. Joe Biden has also recently said Russia could attack NATO if it claims victory in the Ukraine war - with Mr Lavrov appearing to reference this also. ""The absurdity of such statements is clear to everyone, to anyone who understands history in the slightest degree and understands the goals that we openly, without hiding, announced regarding the special military operation in Ukraine,"" Mr Lavrov reportedly told the round table. He said the aim of the war was ""eliminating historical injustice"" and in turn accused the US of leading NATO in threatening Russia's security. 13:26:01 'PoWs' on crashed plane could have been used as 'human shields', Ukraine says Russia has shown ""no readiness"" to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian prisoners allegedly on board a plane that crashed in Belgorod last week, Ukraine has said. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov told broadcaster Suspilne that Kyiv had no evidence confirming the presence of prisoners of war on board the Russian Il-76 aircraft that came down on 24 January. ""That our prisoners were there is Russia's statement, and for now we can only analyse from their words,"" he said. ""At the moment, there is no readiness to transfer the bodies from that side. Nevertheless, from our side, such work continues."" He also suggested the plane could have been carrying ammunition and prisoners who were being used as ""human shields"". Russia did not announce in advance that it would use a plane to transport prisoners, Mr Yusov said, as he called the circumstances of the crash ""provocative"". Ukrainian intelligence previously confirmed a prisoner swap had been prepared for 24 January, but the incident was still being investigated.

Today they announced the 2024 U.S. News Best Companies to Work For: Law Firms list. And it’s quite the read!  U.S. News Managing Editor of Money Susannah Snider’s statement on the ratings gives a sense of what U.S. News is trying to capture with the ranking (besides relevance now that the law school ranking is on the decline). “Professionals evaluating law firms where they can build their careers typically prioritize various needs such as pay, work-life balance and professional development,” said Snider. “To reflect that style of decision-making, the U.S. News Best Companies to Work For: Law Firms takes a modified approach to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to inform an ‘Employee’s Hierarchy of Needs.’ Among other factors, we look at law firms that contribute to a positive work environment and day-to-day employee experience, and offer opportunities for upward mobility.”  But for those actually *in* the industry, I’m not sure how useful the U.S. News numbers really are.  There’s not a cumulative ranking in the U.S. News “ranking.” Paradoxical, I know! But they do provide a scorecard for each firm, which lets you know how they stack up in each of six categories: Quality of pay and benefits; Work/life balance and flexibility; Job and company stability; Physical and psychological comfort; Belongingness and esteem; Career opportunities and professional development.  Before we delve too far into this, a word to the wise: take these numbers with a grain of salt. The methodology is inherently subjective — how exactly are you supposed to measure psychological comfort at a job? Or esteem? Plus it includes people sounding off on forums like Glassdoor and LinkedIn, and there’s an inherent selection bias for those opt-in platforms — just because an associate doesn’t have time to complain on Glassdoor doesn’t mean all is well at a firm. But beyond that, some of these numbers are… a bit of a head scratcher.  Listen, I’ve been covering this industry for a lot of years, and some of these scores just don’t pass the smell test. For example: Milbank — the firm which has consistently raised the bar on compensation — gets a 3!! on salary? WTF? Kirkland — known for its cutthroat culture — gets a 5 for belongingness? Ummmmm, okay? Goodwin, the posterchild for recent layoffs, gets a 5 on stability?? (Maybe the disappearing Fishbowl posts about Goodwin are at work here.) But Baker McKenzie gets a 1 on stability? Why? Make it make sense.  Of course, there is a bunch that does makes sense in the rankings, like Biglaw’s consistently poor work/life balance rating.

1,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-iran-war-biden-retaliation-hezbollah-houthis-iraq-syria-rcna136313,"Both the United States and Iran say they don’t want an all-out war. But after months of attacks and spiraling tensions in the Middle East — culminating in the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Tehran-backed militants — former officials and analysts from the West warn the two countries may be sleepwalking toward conflict.  Sunday’s attack in Jordan was the first time American personnel have been killed in strikes from Iran’s proxies fired in response to Israel’s war in Gaza. President Joe Biden has vowed retaliation — but who the U.S. targets is as yet unclear. More hawkish voices are concerned that a response that’s too weak could fail to stop the mounting threat to American interests; other regional observers fear that a stronger retaliation could be the spark that sets off a wider war.  “The U.S. is in danger of slow-walking itself into a war with Iran,” said Thomas Shannon, former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, the third-highest role in the State Department.  Though Iran itself may not want a war, experts say it has been able to use its militias to challenge American and Western interests in the region without getting directly involved.  While often keeping its language vague, Iran says it has no sway over these groups’ decision-making, and Western experts agree it’s unclear to what extent Tehran has direct control over these forces. Partly because of this ambiguity, the risk of miscalculation and escalation is huge, said Shannon, who has worked in a variety of senior roles under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.  “We’re engaging with people who have every reason to escalate with us because our attacks against them elevate them in their world,” he said. These Iran proxies can cast themselves as “the leading edge of resistance to U.S. presence in the region, to Israel and leading the effort on behalf of Palestinians,” he added.  Iran’s proxies have long been active in the Middle East — what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance” against American and Western influence. But after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, and Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, these Tehran-backed militias have unleashed a fresh wave of violence, which they say is a protest against Israel’s war and a sign of support for the Palestinian cause.  In Lebanon, the militant group Hezbollah has fired daily missiles into Israel, provoking an Israeli response and fears of a repeat of the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006. Yemen’s Houthis have launched rockets and drones toward southern Israel and targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, a key bottleneck for global maritime trade. Meanwhile, militants in Iraq and Syria have launched strikes against American bases across those two countries — and most recently Jordan.  The Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have been targeting international shipping in the Red Sea. Osamah Abdulrahman / AP  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that it was “an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East.” The world, he suggested at a news conference, had “not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the region since at least 1973, and arguably even before that” — referring to that year’s Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Yom Kippur War.  Iran denies orchestrating any of this, although Western governments and independent experts say Tehran is arming, training or funding all of these groups on some level.  The U.S. and its Western allies have hit back, striking targets they said were being used by Iran-linked militias in Syria and Iraq. They have also hit Yemen’s Houthis with airstrikes and lead a multinational task force with the aim of protecting merchant shipping routes in the Red Sea.  However, the drone attack in Jordan raises the stakes, with Biden facing pressure to increase the severity of the U.S. response. That’s led some regional-watchers to wonder whether the militants intended their attack to be deadly at all, knowing it would provoke calls for such an escalation.  It was the third such attack on the base in six months, according to two Pentagon officials, the first two in 2023 being unsuccessful. There are two theories for how the drone evaded defenses at the base, Tower 22: It either flew in as a U.S. drone was also arriving and therefore the defense systems did not recognize it as a threat; or it came in at a very low altitude, the officials said.  A satellite image of the military base known as Tower 22 in northeastern Jordan. Planet Labs PBC / AP  “It’s not 100% clear that this was an intentional escalation on the part of Iran or even on the part of the militias,” said Frank Lowenstein, Obama’s former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. “They’ve launched dozens of these kinds of strikes, and they’ve never killed any American soldiers before.”  Even if it was intentional, it’s unclear how much “command and control” Iran is exerting over these militias, he said. “Is Tehran saying: we want to ramp up the pressure here? Or do these militias, some of whom are fairly obscure, even answer directly to Iran at all?”  In brief remarks Tuesday, Biden said he had decided on a response to the attacks, without giving details. The president said he held Iran responsible for the strike because it provided weapons to the militants, but he reiterated that he was not looking for a wider war.  Blinken said Monday the U.S. would “respond strongly” and “respond at a time and place of our choosing.” He said he wouldn’t give details as to not give the targets a heads-up, but said the response could be “multileveled, come in stages, and be sustained over time.”  Republican congressmen have been spearheading criticism of the president, suggesting that his limited strikes on Iranian militias — rather than Iran itself — has allowed America’s interests to be threatened and a wider war to become more likely.  “The Biden Administration can take out all the Iranian proxies they like, but it will not deter Iranian aggression,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “I am calling on the Biden Administration to strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces, but as deterrence against future aggression.”  Iran also sees the proxy drone and rocket attacks on U.S. troops as a way of forcing the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq, a long-sought goal for Tehran. The Shiite-dominated Iraqi government, which has friendly relations with its more powerful neighbor to the east, has publicly criticized the U.S. over recent airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.  In Lebanon, Hezbollah has fired daily missiles into Israel, provoking an Israeli response and fears of a repeat of the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006. Amir Levy / Getty Images  As the Biden administration weighs its options, the White House may conclude that a strike against a target in Iraq carries just as much political fallout as a bombing raid inside Iran, said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who closely follows Iran’s proxy network in the Middle East.  “It’s almost more sensitive to strike in Iraq than it is in Iran,” he said.  Biden’s options could include bombing targets in Iraq, Syria or Yemen, or he and his advisers may opt to go after Iranian naval ships in the Persian Gulf suspected of aiding Houthi missile and drone attacks at sea, experts said. But both Iran and the U.S. may be misreading each other, former Western officials and experts say.  Tehran may have wrongly assumed that the Biden administration would not be willing to strike directly at Iran, and Washington may have incorrectly calculated that Iran would pull back from a direct confrontation after a succession of limited U.S. airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia and Houthi forces in Yemen.  “They’re trying to deter us and not recognizing that, eventually, we won’t be deterred. And then, we’re doing the same with them,” Knights added. “Basically no one’s deterrence calculus is working.”","U.S. and Iran say they don't want a war, but the risks are mounting as Biden readies retaliation IE 11 is not supported.

But after months of attacks and spiraling tensions in the Middle East — culminating in the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Tehran-backed militants — former officials and analysts from the West warn the two countries may be sleepwalking toward conflict. Sunday’s attack in Jordan was the first time American personnel have been killed in strikes from Iran’s proxies fired in response to Israel’s war in Gaza . President Joe Biden has vowed retaliation — but who the U.S. targets is as yet unclear. More hawkish voices are concerned that a response that’s too weak could fail to stop the mounting threat to American interests; other regional observers fear that a stronger retaliation could be the spark that sets off a wider war. “The U.S. is in danger of slow-walking itself into a war with Iran,” said Thomas Shannon, former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, the third-highest role in the State Department. Biden says he has decided on a response to attack on U.S. soldiers in Jordan Jan. 30, 2024 04:33 Though Iran itself may not want a war, experts say it has been able to use its militias to challenge American and Western interests in the region without getting directly involved. While often keeping its language vague, Iran says it has no sway over these groups’ decision-making, and Western experts agree it’s unclear to what extent Tehran has direct control over these forces. Partly because of this ambiguity, the risk of miscalculation and escalation is huge, said Shannon, who has worked in a variety of senior roles under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. “We’re engaging with people who have every reason to escalate with us because our attacks against them elevate them in their world,” he said. These Iran proxies can cast themselves as “the leading edge of resistance to U.S. presence in the region, to Israel and leading the effort on behalf of Palestinians,” he added. Iran’s proxies have long been active in the Middle East — what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance” against American and Western influence. But after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks , and Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, these Tehran-backed militias have unleashed a fresh wave of violence, which they say is a protest against Israel’s war and a sign of support for the Palestinian cause. In Lebanon, the militant group Hezbollah has fired daily missiles into Israel, provoking an Israeli response and fears of a repeat of the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006. Yemen’s Houthis have launched rockets and drones toward southern Israel and targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, a key bottleneck for global maritime trade. Meanwhile, militants in Iraq and Syria have launched strikes against American bases across those two countries — and most recently Jordan. The Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have been targeting international shipping in the Red Sea. Osamah Abdulrahman / AP Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that it was “an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East.” The world, he suggested at a news conference, had “not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the region since at least 1973, and arguably even before that” — referring to that year’s Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Yom Kippur War. Iran denies orchestrating any of this, although Western governments and independent experts say Tehran is arming, training or funding all of these groups on some level. The U.S. and its Western allies have hit back, striking targets they said were being used by Iran-linked militias in Syria and Iraq. They have  also hit Yemen’s Houthis with airstrikes and lead a multinational task force with the aim of protecting merchant shipping routes in the Red Sea.

2,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/texas-cyclist-killer-caught-yoga-ad-costa-rica,"US authorities have revealed that they captured the convicted killer of the professional cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson with a clever ruse: by placing an advertisement on social media purportedly seeking a yoga instructor, which in turn lured the fugitive out of hiding.  Investigators with the US Marshals Service came up with the ad idea while on an international manhunt for Kaitlin Armstrong, a former yoga instructor who had fled to Costa Rica after killing the 25-year-old Wilson in May 2022 in Austin, Texas, according to newly released information on the case reported on Sunday by the CBS News show 48 Hours.  Armstrong shot and killed Wilson on 11 May 2022 in what prosecutors described as an extreme act of jealousy. Wilson had briefly dated Armstrong’s boyfriend at the time, the cyclist Colin Strickland, after he and Armstrong had broken up.  The night Wilson was killed, she and Strickland had gone swimming together and had dinner. Strickland then dropped Wilson off at a friend’s house, where she had been staying to prepare for an upcoming bike race.  Soon after, Armstrong approached Wilson and shot her several times. A friend later discovered Wilson, who died while bleeding from multiple bullet wounds.  Armstrong evaded authorities for a month and a half by using her sister’s passport to fly to Costa Rica. She assumed several fake identities and underwent plastic surgery to change her appearance.  After intense but unsuccessful search efforts, officers received a tip that Armstrong could be living in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, a small beach town 93 miles (150km) outside the country’s capital, San José.  Authorities initially had difficulty spotting Armstrong in Santa Teresa, a popular travel destination, as many of those in the town physically resembled Armstrong.  “I think from the get-go we were told … you’re gonna be in for a surprise, ‘cause a lot of the women in Santa Teresa look just like Kaitlin – a lot of them,” the deputy US marshal Damien Fernandez said to CBS.  Investigators even enlisted a female operative to take local yoga classes with the hopes of spotting Armstrong, a yoga enthusiast. But police were unable to locate her.  In a last ditch effort, US investigators posted an advertisement looking for a yoga teacher on Facebook.  “Just saying, hey, we’re at this hostel, we’re looking for a yoga instructor as soon as possible. Please contact us at this number,” Fernandez told CBS of the advertisement.  After nearly a week of no responses, Armstrong reached out saying she was interested in the job.  Police arrested Armstrong after confirming she had indeed been the one to respond to the ad, and they extradited her back to Texas to face charges.  A jury in November convicted Armstrong of murder, and she was later sentenced to 90 years in prison.  Armstrong is serving her punishment in Lucille Plane state prison in Dayton, Texas, as the Washington Post reported.","US marshals lure fugitive killer of Texas cyclist out of hiding with yoga ad | Texas | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development More Kaitlin Armstrong leaves court in Austin after receiving a sentence of 90 years over the death of Anna ‘Mo’ Wilson.

BALDOR Updated 12:24 PM GMT+5, January 29, 2024 Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. “shall respond” after three American troops were killed and dozens more were injured in an overnight drone strike in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the first U.S. fatalities after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war . Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist church’s banquet hall. “We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases,” he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, “and we shall respond.” With an increasing risk of military escalation in the region, U.S. officials were working to conclusively identify the precise group responsible for the attack, but they have assessed that one of several Iranian-backed groups was behind it.

China warns US over Taiwan independence US hits Iraq militia sites and anti-ship missiles in Yemen as fight with Iranian proxies intensifies Biden said in a written statement that the United States “will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner (of) our choosing.” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said “we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests.” Iran-backed fighters in east Syria began evacuating their posts, fearing U.S. airstrikes, according to Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet. He told The Associated Press that the areas are the strongholds of Mayadeen and Boukamal. U.S. Central Command said at least 34 troops were injured by the one-way attack drone, with eight flown out of Jordan for follow-up care. It described the eight as being in stable condition. The large drone struck a logistics support base in Jordan known as Tower 22. It is along the Syrian border and is used largely by troops involved in the advise-and-assist mission for Jordanian forces.

U.S. officials identified Tower 22 as the site of the attack. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Read More Central Command said approximately 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel were deployed to the base. The three who were killed and most of the wounded were Army soldiers, according to several U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to give details not yet made public. The small installation, which Jordan does not publicly disclose, includes U.S. engineering, aviation, logistics and security troops. Austin said the troops were deployed there “to work for the lasting defeat of ISIS.” Three officials said the drone struck near the troops’ sleeping quarters, which they said explained the high casualty count. The U.S. military base at al-Tanf in Syria is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Tower 22. The Jordanian installation provides a critical logistical hub for U.S. forces in Syria, including those at al-Tanf, which is near where the borders of Iraq, Syria and Jordan intersect. In a statement on Jordan’s state-run Petra news agency, the country “condemned the terrorist attack” that targeted the U.S. troops. That report described the drone strike as targeting “an outpost on the border with Syria” and said it did not wound any Jordanian troops. “Jordan will continue to counter terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and weapons across the Syrian border into Jordan, and will confront with firmness and determination anyone who attempts to attack the security of the kingdom,” the statement attributed to Muhannad Mubaidin, a government spokesman, said. U.S. troops long have used Jordan, a kingdom bordering Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian territory of the West Bank, Saudi Arabia and Syria, as a basing point. Some 3,000 American troops typically are stationed across Jordan. This is a locator map for Jordan with its capital, Amman. (AP Photo) Since the war in Gaza began Oct. 7, Iranian-backed militias have struck American military installations in Iraq more than 60 times and in Syria more than 90 times, with a mix of drones, rockets, mortars and ballistic missiles. The attack Sunday was the first targeting American troops in Jordan during the Israel-Hamas war and the first to result in the loss of American lives. Scores of U.S. personnel have been wounded, including some with traumatic brain injuries, during the attacks. The militias have said that their strikes are in retaliation for Washington’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza and that they aim to push U.S. forces out of the region. On Monday, Iran’s foreign ministry dismissed the U.S. accusation that Tehran was behind the drone strike,” according to the official IRNA news agency. It quoted ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani as saying that the “Islamic Republic of Iran has no role in decisions by resistance groups on how they support the Palestinian nation or defend their people.” Iran, Kanaani said, is closely watching developments in the region and stressed that the “responsibility for the consequences of provocative accusations against Iran will be on those who raise the baseless allegations.” The U.S. in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iran-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea. “I am confident the Biden Administration will respond in a deliberate and proportional manner,” said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. Republicans in Congress said the administration’s approach had failed to deter America’s adversaries in the region. “We need a major reset of our Middle East policy to protect our national security interests,” said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., went further, urging the administration “to strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces, but as deterrence against future aggression. The only thing the Iranian regime understands is force.” Biden, who was in Columbia, South Carolina, on Sunday, was briefed in the morning by Austin, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. In the afternoon, he met virtually with Vice President Kamala Harris and his national security team for an update. The president, in the written statement, called it a “despicable and wholly unjust attack” and said the service members were “risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism. It is a fight we will not cease.” Syria is still in the midst of a civil war and long has been a launch pad for Iranian-backed forces there, including the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Iraq has multiple Iranian-backed Shiite militias operating there as well. Jordan, a staunch Western ally and a crucial power in Jerusalem for its oversight of holy sites there, is suspected of launching airstrikes in Syria to disrupt drug smugglers, including one that killed nine people earlier this month. An umbrella group for Iran-backed factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq earlier claimed launching explosive drone attacks targeting three areas in Syria, as well as one inside of “occupied Palestine.” The group has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks against bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began. Three officials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with journalists, said the drone attack against the base in Jordan was launched by one of the Iraqi groups. No faction has yet officially claimed responsibility. Officials said the U.S. military is not tracking any other attacks on its forces Sunday in the region. ___ Baldor reported from Washington.

Members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. Alamy file Print Jan. 30, 2024, 6:40 AM PKT By Tom Winter , Dan De Luce and Corky Siemaszko Two Canadian members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang plotted with an Iranian drug trafficker to kill a pair of dissidents who were living in Maryland, the Justice Department and federal officials said Monday. Naji Sharifi Zindashti, aka “Big Guy,” who has ties to Iran's intelligence services , had been communicating with Damion Patrick John Ryan for a month about various ""jobs"" when, in January 2021, he brought up ""a specific job in the United States,"" according to a federal grand jury indictment . Ryan, who was contacting Zindashti through an “encrypted communication service,” said that it would be ""challenging"" but that he ""might have someone to do it,"" the indictment says. That day, the indictment says, Ryan reached out to Adam Richard Pearson, who said he'd need two to three people, including a driver, and ""may charge over $100,000 for the job."" Ryan replied that he would ""get u what you want"" but stressed that it needed to be ""over kill lol,"" U.S. officials said. According to the indictment, Pearson promised to deliver that gruesome message, allegedly saying he would encourage the recruits for the job to “shoot [the victim] in the head a lot [to] make example” and ""We gotta erase his head from his torso."" In the end, neither of the Iranian dissidents lost their heads or their lives. “As alleged, Mr. Zindashti and his team of gunmen, including a Minnesota resident, used an encrypted messaging service to orchestrate an assassination plot against two individuals,” Andrew Luger, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said in a statement. “Thanks to the skilled work of federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents, this murder-for-hire conspiracy was disrupted and the defendants will face justice.” Zindashti, who officials think is in Iran, Ryan and Pearson are each charged with conspiracy to use interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. Pearson, who was living illegally in Minnesota at the time of the alleged plot, is also charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a fugitive from justice and one count of possession of a firearm by an alien unlawfully in the U.S. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have identified Pearson and Ryan as members of the Hells Angels, which has Canadian chapters that the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies consider an organized crime organization. Both are in prison in Canada ""on unrelated offenses,"" the Justice Department said. The men used a service called SkyECC to communicate, the feds said. Sometime around Jan. 30, 2021, Zindashti messaged Ryan for an update in the alleged murder-for-hire plot, the indictment says. Ryan allegedly responded that he was getting “things in order” and that he would need money. Officials say that several days later, Zindashti told Ryan that his organization was ready to move forward and that they agreed on a $350,000 payment for the “job,” plus $20,000 more to cover expenses. It was at that point, U.S. officials allege, that Zindashti introduced Ryan to Co-Conspirator 1, whom the indictment identifies only as ""a resident of Iran."" Recommended Live Updates Live Updates Netanyahu says there will be no compromise on Hamas deal, a prisoner swap or troop withdrawal U.S. news U.S. news Mass. state troopers charged in bribery scheme, accused of taking snow blower and driveway for drivers licenses “We have a 4 man team ready,"" Ryan responded, according to the document. In a separate news release , the Treasury Department identified the Iranian alleged to have worked with Ryan as a Zindashti associate named Nihat Abdul Kadir Asan, ""who has played a pivotal role in logistical planning for many of the network’s operations, including the network’s plot to assassinate individuals in the United States."" Over the next few days, Co-Conspirator 1 supplied Ryan with information and photographs of the targets, who are a man and a woman, and discussed the price for the double hit, according to the indictment. ""When RYAN told Co-Conspirator 1 that two targets would cost more than one, Co-Conspirator 1 assured RYAN that this was not a problem,"" the indictment says. In March of that year, Ryan got a first payment of $20,000 ""for the purpose of covering travel expenses associated with the plot to murder the victims."" The Treasury Department has taken ""action against Zindashti’s criminal network that targets Iranian dissidents and opposition activists for kidnapping and assassination at the direction of the Iranian regime."" The Justice Department said in a statement, ""Zindashti and several of his key associates are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing that involves a U.S. person or occurs in the United States."" Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Iran has a history of assassinations and abductions around the world, and it has, at times, recruited local criminals to carry out the killings, according to U.S. and European governments. In 2018, an Iranian man who had lived a quiet life as an electrician for years in the Netherlands was gunned down in broad daylight in Almere, east of Amsterdam. The victim turned out to be Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, 56, who had been sentenced to death in Iran after he was accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic Party’s headquarters in 1981, killing 73 people — including many senior political figures. The Dutch government alleged that the Iranian regime was behind the fatal shooting. Iran denied any role in the killing and has denied being behind other suspected assassinations. Last year, federal prosecutors charged three members of an eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran’s government with conspiring to assassinate Masih Alinejad. Alinejad is a journalist and dissident with a large online following who has long been a thorn in the side of the regime.

Toyota Print Jan. 30, 2024, 5:40 PM PKT / Source : Reuters By Reuters WASHINGTON — Toyota Motor said on Monday it is urging the owners of 50,000 older U.S. vehicles to get immediate recall repairs because an air bag inflator could explode and potentially kill motorists. The Japanese automaker said the “Do Not Drive” advisory covers some 2003-2004 model year Corolla, 2003-2004 Corolla Matrix, and 2004-2005 RAV4s with Takata air bag inflators. More than 30 deaths worldwide, including 26 U.S. deaths, and hundreds of injuries in various automakers’ vehicles since 2009 are linked to Takata air bag inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. Over the last decade, more than 67 million Takata air bag inflators have been recalled in the United States by more than 20 automakers, and more than 100 million inflators worldwide, in the biggest auto safety callback in history. Toyota said the RAV4 recall involves the driver’s airbag while the other recalls involve the front passenger airbag only. In some Corolla and Corolla Matrix models, certain vehicles are also involved in a second recall that can cause the airbag to deploy even without a crash. There have been prior “Do Not Drive” warnings issued by other automakers for vehicles with older Takata air bag inflators after fatal crashes. Toyota declined to answer if the “Do Not Drive” warning had been prompted by a serious injury or fatal incident involving one of the vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately comment.

In November 2022, Stellantis urged owners of 276,000 other older U.S. vehicles to immediately stop driving after three other crash deaths tied to faulty Takata air bag inflators were reported that year. Honda Motor in February 2023 issued a “Do Not Drive” warning for 8,200 Acura and Honda vehicles after the death of the driver of a 2002 Accord in Bowling Green, Kentucky from a faulty Takata air bag inflator.

0,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2024-01-30/biden-reaches-decision-on-response-to-drone-attack,"President Joe Biden has made a decision on how he wants to respond to the drone attack that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan over the weekend. But he's not yet saying what it is.    Biden is under pressure to respond forcefully to the attack, which the United States believes was done by Iran-backed militants. But Biden must also balance the desire for a definitive – and perhaps sustained – response without drawing the United States into a broader war in an increasingly tense and violent Middle East.  Asked if he had made a decision on how to respond, the president said simply ""yes,"" as he departed the White House for a campaign event in Florida.    The Week in Cartoons Jan. 29 - Feb. 2 View All 8 Images  He declined to elaborate on what form that response would take, but cautioned, ""I don't think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That's not what I'm looking for.""  Biden said he did hold Iran responsible for the attack ""in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people who did it.""  Biden called the families of the three slain service members Tuesday morning, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters en route to Florida. The president will also travel Friday to Dover Air Force base in Delaware for the “dignified transfer” ceremony of the troops, Kirby said, after being assured by the families that they welcomed his presence there.    Some Republicans – eager to punish Iran and aware of the delicate position Biden is in, during an election year – have urged the president to retaliate forcefully in Iran.  Failure to respond aggressively and definitively could damage Biden in the presidential campaign, making him vulnerable to charges that he is weak on Iran. Republicans have already criticized the administration for allowing the release last year of Iranian funds for humanitarian purposes, a move that coincided with the release of American detainees.    But a worse electoral and national security option for Biden would be drawing the United States into a war with Iran, particularly with the region in turmoil. Israel is continuing its attacks on Gaza – provoking complaints that Biden is not doing enough to achieve a cease-fire there – and the United States is working to get Hamas-held hostages out of its territory.  Kirby said Tuesday the U.S. response to the attack in Jordan would be “tiered,” but he provided no further details. On Monday, he said he would not ""telegraph any punches"" the United States plans in response to the drone attack.

1,https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/how-hard-is-medical-school-and-what-is-the-med-school-curriculum,"While it might be a breath of fresh air to finish an undergraduate education, plunging into medical school next is a rigorous challenge that all prospective doctors must prepare for.  Medical School vs. Undergraduate Coursework: What's the Difference?  “Undergrad is difficult, especially as a premedical student, and we have this goal in mind and we're really oriented towards that goal to a point where maybe we let go of other things like family and friends and things like that during undergrad,” says Ayleen Hernandez, a fourth-year student at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. “There's a weight off our shoulders once we're in med school, but then the weight comes back quickly because it is extremely difficult.”  The first year or two of med school are reminiscent of undergrad, she says, because the are very lecture-based.  “However, the content and the amount that we get all at once makes it so difficult,” she says. “There's a metaphor that med school is like drinking out of a fire hydrant because it's so much information all at once.”  Another analogy she hears a lot is that med school is like a stack of pancakes. “If you eat one pancake a day, it's not so bad,” she says, “but if you let the pancakes accumulate, and then you have to eat 10 pancakes in one day, then it gets really bad.”  Hernandez says new med students need to be sure to stay on top of their work and have good time-management skills.  “In undergrad, you usually have three or four, maybe five classes depending upon if you're on quarters or semesters,” says Suzanne Allen, vice dean for academic, rural and regional affairs at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “Just think about doubling that as far as the amount of information you're supposed to learn in any given quarter or semester. We're providing information to people, probably at least twice as much as you experience in undergrad.”  Allen says she tells incoming students that medical school is a full-time job.  “Even when you're doing the book-learning phase of medical school, you can expect that you will be working eight hours a day, either in class or studying for the amount of information that we're expecting you to learn,” she says.  Year 1 of Medical School  The first year and a half of the four years at medical school is what Allen calls the classroom phase or foundation phase. Students learn all systems of the body, such as the cardiovascular, pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems.  “For most students, the first year is the hardest year and the first year of medical school, at most institutions, tends to be very scientific, foundation-based with a lot of scientific information,” says David Lambert, senior associate dean for medical school education and a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.  He says the first two years are similar in that students learn about the different organ systems and begin to connect that information with their clinical work when they get exposure to actual patients.  One change in medical school over the last decade or two is having clinical patient interactions much earlier in a student’s four-year journey, experts say.  Students jump into clinical work right at the start of medical school at the University of Washington, Allen says.  “That's, of course, much different than when I went to medical school,"" she says. ""We have a course that runs throughout the foundation's phase called 'Foundations of Clinical Medicine.' In that course, students are learning how to do a history and physical exam, and then they're actually interviewing patients during the exams.”  Early clinical work has become prevalent at many U.S. medical schools.  “During the first year, our students are working with standardized patients, task trainers, high-fidelity mannequins,” says Stephen Charles, associate dean of curriculum at Baylor College of Medicine. “Starting in the very first course, they really are focused on how to take a history and physical exam, and students will go into clinical preceptorships their second week of medical school.”  Preceptorships are mentoring experiences in which a practicing doctor voluntarily provides supervision and personal training to a med student during the first two years of school.  Year 2 of Medical School  “For year two, they're summarizing and we have a course that gives students time for self-reflection and self-directed learning to consolidate all of the information that they've learned in year 1 across the organ systems,” Charles says.  Baylor also has a fundamentals of academic scholarship and translational research course that teaches students basic skills in clinical and other types of research areas of interest.  “When they take this course they also have to have found a scholarly adviser or inquiry adviser to help mentor them through a research project,” he says. “Students actually are getting to pick the research project that they would like to focus on that they think will help them in their careers, and the students will work on this research project for the rest of their medical school until their fourth year.”  Some projects focus on topics like behavioral research, community-based research, educational research, health services research or quality improvement.  Lambert says transitioning into the second year of medical school is a bit more fun for students because they get to see how the organ systems and the diseases and processes associated with them fit together as they engage in clinical work.  “At about 18 to 24 months is when students have some really immersive clinical experiences and they go through different rotations like surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, all of those,” he says. “That is challenging, in a different way, because there's the integration, there's the socialization, there's the reality of health care there.”  This period is when interpersonal and patient care skills are really developed. Lambert says it’s also physically challenging to students, since they haven’t been in that work environment before, but it’s also much more rewarding.  Hernandez says this was the hardest time frame for her – during the second half of the second year in med school – and was like having a full-time job.  “This is when we join and start our core clerkships, which we start in January, and those core clerkships are basically all of the required rotations that we all need to be trained in ... all of those well-known specialties that we need to have familiarity with,” she says.  For 12 months, they’re rotating toward those clerkships, taking exams and joining a team in every rotation, Hernandez says. “We're there as learners, but we also try to be useful to the team and form connections with patients. So it's really kind of our first introduction to being almost like providers, but of course we're still learners.”    Most students take the first part of the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination, or USMLE, after the second year of med school. The first part recently transitioned to pass/fail.  Step one, typically taken at the end of the second year of medical school, is basic science, biology, the ""nitty-gritty"" of medicine, but not clinical applications such as how to use medicine to treat a patient, Hernandez says. The second step, which focuses more on medicine and patient interaction, is graded and taken after the third year or in the fourth year of med school.  Step three is typically taken after the first year of postgraduate training, also known as residency. Passage of the USMLE is required to receive a license to practice medicine in the U.S.  Years 3 and 4 of Medical School  At Washington, Allen says, the rotations are in the third and fourth years. They include 12 weeks of internal medicine; six weeks each of family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrician/gynecology, surgery and psychiatry; four weeks each of emergency medicine and neurology, and one-month rotations – often considered sub-internships – in advanced patient care.  “If you're going to go into family medicine, you would do an advanced patient care rotation in family medicine, or if you are going to go into pediatrics, you do it in pediatrics,” she says.  Initial rotations are when students really hone in on a specialization.  Lambert says the last year of med school tends to be a bit lighter because there is more time for electives.  Washington requires five one-month electives in areas such as global health, cardiology, hematology and orthopedics.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",How Hard Is Medical School and What Is the Med School Curriculum?,5 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

(AP) — New York will expand its legal definition of rape to include various forms of nonconsensual sexual contact, under a bill signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday.  The state’s current limited definition was a factor in writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual abuse and defamation case against former President Donald Trump. The jury in the federal civil trial rejected the writer’s claim last May that Trump had raped her in the 1990s, instead finding the former president responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse.  The current law defines rape as vaginal penetration by a penis. The new law broadens the definition to include nonconsensual anal, oral, and vaginal sexual contact. Highlighting Carroll's case at a bill signing ceremony in Albany, the Democratic governor said the new definition will make it easier for rape victims to bring cases forward to prosecute perpetrators. The law will apply to sexual assaults committed on or after Sept. 1.  “The problem is, rape is very difficult to prosecute,"" Hochul said. “Physical technicalities confuse jurors and humiliate survivors and create a legal gray area that defendants exploit.”  In Carroll's case against Trump, which stemmed from an encounter at a Manhattan luxury department store, the judge later said that the jury’s decision was based on “the narrow, technical meaning” of rape in New York penal law and that, in his analysis, the verdict did not mean that Carroll “failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  While various states define rape in different ways, every state criminalizes oral, anal, and vaginal sexual contact that is nonconsensual, according to Sandi Johnson, a senior legislative policy counsel at Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network. Prior to its new law, New York defined penetration of the vagina or other bodily orifices with anything other than a penis as “sexual abuse” rather than “rape.”  Many other states continue to place unwanted oral or anal sexual contact in a category other than rape.  Johnson said New York's new guidelines validate what has happened to survivors. Calling a criminal sexual act anything other than rape “kind of sanitizes it,” she said.  At Tuesday's bill signing, state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who sponsored the legislation, said the new changes would also make it easier for members of the LGBTQ community to hold perpetrators of sex crimes accountable.  “We can’t have our laws ignore the reality that so many New Yorkers, particularly LGBTQ New Yorkers, among others, have experienced,” the Democrat said.  “Before today, many of those assaults wouldn’t be able to be classified as rape in New York state,"" he said. “But now we fixed that language.""  ___  Associated Press writer Mike Sisak contributed to this report.

3,https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2024-01-30/washington-state-to-develop-guidelines-for-agencies-using-generative-ai,"SEATTLE (AP) — The governor of Washington on Tuesday called for the state to develop best practices on how agencies should use generative artificial intelligence as it continues to incorporate the technology into government operations.  “It’s our duty to the public to be thorough and thoughtful in how we adopt these powerful new tools,” Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement.  States across the U.S. have taken similar steps within the last two years, often opting to focus on how their own state governments handle the technology before setting private sector restrictions. Earlier this month, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order creating an AI subcabinet that will develop a plan to create appropriate guardrails for agencies’ use of AI.  The executive order in Washington highlights the huge potential for generative AI, including how it could be beneficial for language translation, code generation and contract management. But it also addresses the risks that can come with these types of “trailblazing technologies.”  “Some AI models still have significant quality limitations, raise privacy and security concerns, and have been shown to reinforce social biases,” the governor’s office said in a statement.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The order called for WaTech, the agency at the helm of the state’s technology services, to work with state officials to come up with guidelines for how the government can procure this technology and monitor its use. The guidelines are meant to build on some of the principles laid out in the Biden administration’s 2022 Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, a set of far-reaching goals aimed at averting harms caused by the rise of artificial intelligence systems.  Inslee wants to see an AI training plan developed for government workers that outline how the technology could help state operations as well as its risks to residents and cybersecurity. And he called for state agencies, along with tribal governments, community members and others to come up with best practices for how agencies should evaluate the impact this technology could have on vulnerable communities.  “Our goal is to help the state continue using generative AI in ways that help the public while putting up guardrails around uses that present a lot of risk,” said Katy Ruckle, the state’s chief privacy officer.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Washington State to Develop Guidelines for Agencies Using Generative AI,1 hour ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
4,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2024-01-30/these-states-have-banned-the-type-of-deepfake-porn-that-targeted-taylor-swift,"The public backlash persists over the fake, sexually explicit images of Taylor Swift that recently circulated online. But regulating those AI-generated images may pose more challenges than many realize, as only 10 states have directly outlawed some form of the practice amid the rapid growth of artificial intelligence.    The pornographic and digitally altered images of the superstar singer-songwriter and musician spread last week on social media websites such as X, formerly Twitter. The images were deepfakes, a relatively new term for a seemingly realistic but manipulated video or photo produced by a form of AI. The technology first appeared in late 2017, and subsequent code-sharing has made it more widely available for use, according to the nonprofit Organization for Social Media Safety.  “Part of the problem is that the technology has become less expensive, more accessible and the products of the technology more believable, while the laws and the protections have not evolved as quickly,” says Judith Germano, an adjunct professor and distinguished fellow at NYU School of Law. “So we need laws, standards, guardrails and political and public discourse that addresses this very serious problem, which has existed for years and seems to become more prevalent as a form of sexual exploitation, abuse, manipulation.”    There is currently no federal law against disseminating such content. However, some legal professionals believe “such illicit practices may not require new legislation, as they already fall under a patchwork of existing privacy, defamation or intellectual property laws,” according to an article by Law.com.  But the proliferation of such deepfakes is getting the attention of government officials – both nationally and at the state level. On Oct. 30, 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order directing “the establishment of new standards for AI safety and security” while also ordering the Office of Management and Budget to “consider the risks of deepfake image-based sexual abuse of adults and children” in its upcoming AI procurement guidelines.    Additionally, at least the 10 states below now have legislation that specifically targets those who create and share explicit deepfake content, as reported by USA Today. Many laws were passed in the last year or so, and outline penalties ranging from fines to possible jail time for offenders.    The attempts to combat deepfake practices are not perfect. Germano says some of the state laws require an “illicit motive,” which she notes could put a high burden on the victim to prove their case. States also need to discern, she says, whether their existing laws related to subjects such as privacy, harassment and defamation are enough, or “should be better defined or expanded.” Most states, for example, have specific laws against revenge porn, a form of cyber sexual harassment.  “I think that it’s a combination of the need for states to have better expertise in how to properly define deepfakes and what appropriate remedies are, so that they are developing laws that are broad enough to address the serious harms, but not stifling other less nefarious uses of the technology,” Germano says.    Despite the challenges that lawmakers and regulators face, she notes how important it is that the harmful practice is getting more notice.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",These States Have Banned the Type of Deepfakes That Targeted Taylor Swift,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
5,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/countries-that-ban-the-sale-of-vapes-e-cigarettes,"A recently announced plan by the United Kingdom to ban the sale of disposable vapes is among the latest efforts by countries to limit access to e-cigarettes to curb their use among children.    In the U.S., electronic nicotine delivery systems have been a public health concern for years after their introduction into the market in 2007. Monthly e-cigarette sales in the country increased from 15.5 million units in 2020 to 22.7 million in 2022, according to a recent study cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and they are the most common tobacco product used by young people.  While proponents contend e-cigarettes can help users of traditional, more harmful cigarettes kick the habit, critics say the packaging of such devices – along with fruit and candy flavors they’re often offered in – target children, who can become addicted to nicotine and put themselves at risk of inhaling other harmful materials by using the devices.    CDC researchers last year published a study showing an estimated 7.7% of middle and high school students, or about 2 million in total, were current e-cigarette users in 2023. More than 60% of youth e-cigarette users used disposable vapes, with popular brands including Elf Bar and Esco Bar. In the U.K., where officials also hope to stop refillable vapes from being sold in child-friendly flavors and packaging, 9% of 11- to 15-year-olds reportedly use vapes.  The Food and Drug Administration regulates e-cigarettes in the U.S., authorizing products on a case-by-case basis that involves an assessment of the risk they’ll be used by young people. So far, the FDA has approved only 23 e-cigarette products and devices, effectively rendering unauthorized products often found on store shelves illegal and manufacturers and retailers subject to enforcement. Yet that enforcement has proved challenging: Citing data from analytics firm Circana, The Associated Press reported late last year that more than 11,500 unique vaping products were being sold in U.S. stores, up from 9,000 products in June.    Globally, as many as 121 countries or territories regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems, based on a 2023 World Health Organization report.

The business group’s consumer confidence index rose to 114.8 from a revised 108 in December. It was the highest reading since December 2021 and the third consecutive monthly increase.  The present situation Index – a measure of current business and labor market conditions – surged to 161.3 from 147.2 last month. The expectations index – a short-term outlook for income, business, and job market conditions – rose slightly to 83.8 from a revised reading of 81.9 in December.  The gains were broad among income levels and age.    The Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images  “January’s increase in consumer confidence likely reflected slower inflation, anticipation of lower interest rates ahead, and generally favorable employment conditions as companies continue to hoard labor,” said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the board. “The gain was seen across all age groups, but largest for consumers 55 and over. Likewise, confidence improved for all income groups except the very top; only households earning $125,000+ saw a slight dip.”  Inflation expectations, meanwhile, fell to a three-year low and consumers’ assessment of their own income and personal finances were favorable over the next six months, while fears of a recession ebbed.  “Concerns of a recession in the first half of 2024 have significantly diminished, as the strength of the U.S. economy continues to shine,” said Stephen Rich, chairman & CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management. “Robust consumer and government spending are propelling GDP growth, and the job market remains resilient. As the new year unfolds, we are watching for anything that might reverse the downward path of inflation, which would delay the start of the Fed easing cycle and keep pressure on the economy for longer.”    The Conference Board report is yet another, along with last week’s benign reading on inflation, that consumers are feeling better in early 2024 than they were through much of last year.  And it comes as the Federal Reserve is meeting in Washington to set interest rate policy, with economists forecasting the central bank will hold interest rates steady.  “The expectation has been that inflation was going to come down,” says Melissa Brown, head of applied research at Simcorp. “If you go back a year, everyone was saying the Fed was late.”  But now the soft landing scenario that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has often referenced, where inflation falls and the economy grows without tipping into recession, is the conventional wisdom.    “You have inflation rolling over faster than expected,” says Gene Goldman, chief investment office at Cetera Investment Management. But, he adds, “The Fed’s not going to change” at its first meeting of 2024 that began on Tuesday and do anything other than hold interest rates steady for the fourth meeting in a row. “Services inflation is still too high.”  LegalShield, a firm that provides legal services directly to consumers, has a somewhat less optimistic view of the state of Americans’ finances. Its consumer stress legal index released last week saw its 10th month of increased financial concern in December.  The index often leads other consumer sentiment surveys by two to three months, says LegalShield CEO Warren Schlichting.  “It is a contradiction to what we’re hearing” about a strong economy, Schlichting says, “But it’s been pretty accurate over the last 20 years.”  In particular, he asks whether the recovery is being fueled by an increase in credit card spending.    “In the third and fourth quarters, conversations about consumer finances reached an all-time high,” he adds.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number of job openings ended 2023 at 9 million, a slight increase from a month earlier and consistent with a strong labor market.  The job openings report comes in a week that also features private payroll firm ADP’s monthly survey of employers for January and Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department. Economists expect ADP to say that 148,000 jobs were added, while the government’s January jobs number is forecast to be around 180,000.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Consumers Are Getting Happier by the Minute as Confidence Reaches 2-Year High,6 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, was experiencing a “widespread system outage"" from a “cybersecurity incident,” county commission Chair Robb Pitts said Monday in a video posted on social media. Notably, he said, the outage is affecting the county's phone, court and tax systems.  But the office of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said the racketeering case against Trump and others is not affected.  “All material related to the election case is kept in a separate, highly secure system that was not hacked and is designed to make any unauthorized access extremely difficult if not impossible,"" Willis' office said in a statement.  But the prosecutor's office said its operations were being “drastically” affected by the electronic court filing system outage. Visitors to the website that houses Fulton County's online court records were greeted by a message saying it is “temporarily unavailable.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Additionally, the statement said, the Atlanta Police Department was not sending emails to or opening emails from the district attorney's office out of concern for its own systems. That was hindering prosecutors' work because about 85% of their cases come from Atlanta police.  A Fulton County grand jury in August indicted Trump and 18 others. They’re accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. Four people have already pleaded guilty after reaching plea deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others who remain have pleaded not guilty.  Pitts said the outage was reported to law enforcement and was under investigation. The FBI office in Atlanta confirmed that it was aware of the breach and had been in contact with the county's information technology department but declined to discuss specifics.  County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt said Tuesday there was no estimate for when the outage would be repaired.

(AP) — Evan Bates sat on a table at the U.S. figure skating championships last weekend, feeling lousy despite having just won a fifth ice dance national title because of a flu bug that nearly kept him from performing with partner Madison Chock.  He felt a lot better — in a lot of ways — by Tuesday morning.  That's when Bates and Chock awoke to learn they were suddenly Olympic champions. The Court of Arbitration for Sport had ruled a day earlier that Kamilia Valieva of the winning Russian squad would be disqualified following a failed doping test taken ahead of the 2022 Beijing Games, presumably elevating the second-place Americans to first in the team event. But exactly how to allocate the medals was left in the hands of the IOC and the International Skating Union.  That decision, not without a bit of controversy of its own, was delivered about 24 hours later.  “To be honest, I think having insight into what was going to happen was incredibly difficult throughout the entire process,” Bates said Tuesday. “We really had no idea even Sunday night. We were bracing ourselves for news that it was going to be silver.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The news that it would be gold touched off a stream of celebratory text messages among the nine members of the team.  Among them, only Chock and Bates are still competing.  Nathan Chen, who won individual Olympic gold with his dramatic performance set to music by Elton John, has been focusing on school, though he has yet to officially retire. He also penned a memoir and a children's book, worked in television, and has been active with several philanthropic causes; later this month, he will participate in a celebration of Scott Hamilton's gold medal from the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics while helping to raise money for cancer research.  “This decision is certainly a win for clean sport,” Chen said of the CAS decision during an interview with CNN This Morning on Tuesday. “However, the fact that this happened at all is a win for no one.”  In the case of the Americans, it denied them and everyone else the opportunity to stand on the Olympic podium in Beijing.  Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said plans already are underway to recognize the American team, despite potential appeals by the Russian team, which was dropped to third following Valieva's disqualification, and the Canadian team, which is arguing that the Russians should be DQ'd altogether and its own team given the bronze medal.  Chock said in text messages among Team USA that the preference is to hold a medal ceremony at this year's Paris Olympics.  “That would be our dream scenario,” she said.  It also would give the American team a rare opportunity to reconnect.  Much like Chen, teammate Vincent Zhou turned his attention to school work at Brown. Karen Chen plans to graduate from Cornell next year. Madison Hubbell and ice dance partner Zach Donohue have both gotten married since the Beijing Games — Hubbell to Spanish ice dancer Adrian Diaz and Donohue to Australian dancer Chantelle Kerry.  The pairs team of Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, who won the world title after the Olympics and took silver last year, are taking this season off from competition. But they have not ruled out competing at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics.  “I think the team is very tightly knit,” Bates said, “and this experience has actually brought us closer together. We're the only two still competing, and that just goes to show the lifespan of an Olympic athlete. In most cases, not long, and that makes a two-year wait difficult and challenging. But I think the communication over the last 24 hours has been incredibly celebratory, and a lot of it has been, ‘I love you guys. I love this team.’  “Yes,” Bates said, “the medals are great, but it's more about the bond and friendship. It's an incredible group of athletes. I hope this team will be remembered for how we handled this situation off the ice as well as how we performed on the ice.”  ___",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",US Figure Skaters Celebrate Gold Medal From Beijing Olympics With a Touch of Bittersweetness,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
9,https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2024-01-30/chita-rivera-revered-and-pioneering-tony-winning-dancer-and-singer-dies-at-91,"NEW YORK (AP) — Chita Rivera, the dynamic dancer, singer and actress who garnered 10 Tony nominations, winning twice, in a long Broadway career that forged a path for Latina artists and shrugged off a near-fatal car accident, died Tuesday. She was 91.  Rivera's death was announced by her daughter, Lisa Mordente, who said she died in New York after a brief illness.  Rivera first gained wide notice in 1957 as Anita in the original production of ""West Side Story"" and was still dancing on Broadway with her trademark energy a half-century later in 2015’s “The Visit.”  ""I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn't moving or telling a story to you or singing a song,"" she told The Associated Press then. ""That's the spirit of my life, and I'm really so lucky to be able to do what I love, even at this time in my life.""  In August 2009, Rivera was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the U.S. can give a civilian. Rivera put her hand over her heart and shook her head in wonderment as President Barack Obama presented the medal. In 2013, she was the marshal at the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “She was a true Broadway legend,” playwright Paul Rudnick said on X, formerly Twitter. “She always delivered and audiences adored her. The moment she stepped onstage, the world became more exciting and glorious.”  Rivera rose from chorus girl to star, collaborating along the way with many of Broadway’s greatest talents, including Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael Kidd, Harold Prince, Jack Cole, Peter Gennaro and John Kander and Fred Ebb.  She rebounded from a car accident in 1988 that crushed her right leg and became an indefatigable star on the road. She was on Broadway in a raucous production of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” in 2012 and the chilly “The Visit” in 2014, earning another best actress Tony nomination.  “She can’t rehearse except for full-out,” said playwright Terrence McNally in 2005. “She can’t perform except for full-out, no matter what the size of the house. She’s going to be there 101% for that audience.”  She won Tonys for “The Rink” in 1984 and “Kiss of the Spider Woman” in 1993. When accepting a Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2018, she said “I wouldn’t trade my life in the theater for anything, because theater is life.”  She was nominated for the award seven other times, for “Bye Bye Birdie,” which opened in 1960; “Chicago,” 1975; ""Bring Back Birdie,” 1981; “Merlin,” 1983; “Jerry’s Girls,” 1985; “Nine,” 2003; and “Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life,” 2005.  “I don’t think we have enough original musicals,” she told The Associated Press in 2012. “I know I’m being old fashioned, but the theater is the place where music, lyrics, words, scenery and stories come together. And I’ve been blessed enough to have done several shows when they really did. They take you places and they’re daring. That’s what we need.”  Her albums include 16 tracks pulled from her original cast recordings and put out as part of Sony’s Legends of Broadway series and two solo CDs — “And Now I Sing” for a tiny record label in the 1960s and “And Now I Swing” in 2009 for Yellow Sound Label.  “I looked up to you and always will admire you as a talent and mostly as a person!” wrote Kristin Chenoweth on X. “A kick butt woman you were. All the rest of us just wanna be you.”  In the 1993 musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Rivera played the title role, a glamorous movie star at the center of the fantasy life of an inmate in a South American prison. The story, from a novel by Manuel Puig, had already been made into an Oscar-winning 1985 movie.  In his review, then-Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara wrote that Rivera “is more than a musical theater star. She’s a force of nature — which is exactly what is needed for the role of the Spider Woman. With her Louise Brooks haircut, brassy voice and lithe dancer’s body, Rivera dominates the stage whenever she appears.”  In 1975, she originated the role of Velma Kelly (to Gwen Verdon’s Roxie Hart) in the original Broadway production of “Chicago.” Rivera had a small role in the 2002 film version, while Catherine Zeta-Jones won the best supporting actress Oscar as Velma — just as Rita Moreno had picked up an Oscar for her portrayal of Anita in “West Side Story.”  The songwriters for “Chicago,” Kander and Ebb, also wrote Rivera’s first Tony-winning performance, for “The Rink.” In winning the Tony for best actress in a musical, Rivera topped the show’s top star, Liza Minnelli, who also had been nominated. The two played a mother and daughter who struggle to rebuild their relationship after a long estrangement; the setting is an old-fashioned roller rink that has seen better days.  “Spider Woman” had been her first Broadway show since 1986, when she suffered a broken leg in the traffic accident while she was appearing in “Jerry’s Girls,” a Broadway tribute to the songs of Jerry Herman.  At the Tony awards a few weeks later, she flashed her cast and belted out “Put on a Happy Face” from the musical “Bye, Bye, Birdie.”  It took months of physical therapy to bring back her dancing skills. She told The Associated Press: “It never entered my mind that I wouldn’t dance again. Never. I can’t explain to you why. It’s hard work getting back but that’s what I’m doing.”  “My spirit is still there.”  Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero was born Jan. 23, 1933, in Washington, D.C. Her Puerto Rican father, Pedro del Rivero, was a musician who played in the United States Navy Band, who died when she was 7. Her mother was Scottish and Italian descent.  She took dance classes and then entered the prestigious School of American Ballet in New York. Her first theater gig, at age 17, was in the touring company of “Call Me Madam.” That led to chorus stints in such shows as “Guys and Dolls” and “Can-Can.”  In her 2023 memoir, “Chita: A Memoir,” another woman steals scene after scene: her self-proclaimed alter ego, Dolores. Unapologetic and fiery, Dolores was the unfiltered version of Chita and served as motivation in times of self-doubt. In one chapter, Rivera writes that she doesn’t read reviews “or Dolores just might invest in a dozen voodoo dolls.”  “I consist of — and I think we all do — I consist of two people: Dolores and Conchita,” Rivera sain in an interview with the AP that year. “Conchita, she’s the one that has been taking all the glory, you know. She’s been doing all the shows, but Dolores is the one that’s pushed her into it. And she’s been keeping me on track, so I listen to Dolores. I listen to her. She’s growing in my head now as we speak.”  Among other early appearances on the New York stage were roles in “The Shoestring Revue,” 1955; a 1955 musical version of “Seventh Heaven” starring Ricardo Montalban; and “Mr. Wonderful,” a 1956 show starring Sammy Davis Jr.  “I can’t believe that I’ve been given the gift to look back and relive my life,” she told The Associated Press shortly before “The Dancer’s Life” opened on Broadway in late 2005. “It’s about how anybody can do it — if you really believe it, you have the good fortune, you do all the right things and you really work hard.”  Rivera, who had a relationship with the now-deceased Davis, married fellow “West Side Story” performer Tony Mordente in 1957. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Lisa Mordente, also became a performer who occasionally appeared on Broadway, garnering a Tony nomination in 1982 for “Marlowe.”  “Our hearts go out to everyone who loved her,” GLAAD said in a statement. “Rivera spent much of her long career advocating for LGBTQ people and people living with HIV and AIDS.”  ___  Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Chita Rivera, Revered and Pioneering Tony-Winning Dancer and Singer, Dies at 91",3 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

(AP) — A teachers strike in a Boston suburb entered its eighth day Tuesday — one of the longest in recent state history — with both sides still unable to agree on salaries and other issues.  The Newton School Committee on Tuesday said it made another revised offer to the Newton Teachers Association, which it described as “a fair and competitive offer that addresses the concerns that the NTA has expressed to the negotiating team and publicly.”  “Throughout the duration of the strike, we have presented increasingly competitive (cost of living adjustment) proposals, even when compared to the highest-paying peer districts,” the committee said in a statement.  The union has said it is seeking living wages for all employees, increased paid family leave time and a guarantee that social workers will be placed in every elementary and middle school.  The school committee proposal addresses union priorities, according to the school committee, including 12 weeks paid parental leave, smaller class sizes and increased social worker support for students.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  David Bedar, a member of the union and a history teacher at Newton North High School said the union has received the latest counterproposal. He said there was some movement by the school committee, but that movement was based on pulling back on other union priorities.  “So negotiations are still ongoing,” he said.  It is illegal for public workers, including teachers, to strike in Massachusetts. Newton has a population of more than 87,000.  A judge last week began doubling fines for the teachers union until it reached a total of $375,000 by the end of week at which point the judge opted to add $50,000 a day — for Monday and Tuesday — bringing the total to $475,000.  Newton City Council President Marc Laredo called for both sides to reach a deal quickly.  “This strike has to end. We need to get our kids back in the classroom and we need to do it now,” Laredo said. “All the responsible parties — the teachers, the school committee, those providing funding — need to be at the table.”  Tensions were beginning to fray.  A lawsuit was filed Monday in Middlesex District Court by Lital Asher-Dotan. The Newton mother of three — two high schoolers and a student in 8th grade — was asking the court to compel the teachers union to end the strike.  In the lawsuit, Asher-Dotan said one of her children is facing setbacks during a critical high school year that could jeopardize her chance of college acceptance. She said her children have also missed part of the hockey season and opportunities with the ski team club.  “The prolonged strike exacerbates these issues, especially for students with special needs,” the lawsuit said.  Other parents have started an online petition urging the union and city “to continue your negotiations while enabling students and teachers to get back to the classroom.”  “Our children are being deprived of their right to an education. We believe the NTA and City are so mired in their drive to advocate for their perspectives such that the children’s interests have been subordinated in the need to win,” the petition said.  The district educates nearly 12,000 students across more than 20 schools.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Teachers Strike in Boston Suburb Enters Its Eighth Day, With Tensions Fraying",59 mins ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

When the Niners get a second shot at a Super Bowl against the Kansas City Chiefs it will be a rare title game rematch in this short of a span.  “It’s perfect,"" 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa said about getting a second shot to knock off Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in the past five seasons.  ""They’re as great an organization, coach, quarterback as there is. And they were down, not looking great this year either, and they’re playing they’re best ball now. So it’s going to be a big challenge.”  There have only been eight Super Bowl rematches in the previous 57 games, with just three happening in a five-year span before this rematch. The winners of those three rematches were the teams that won the first meeting.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  There will be more than a dozen players scheduled to appear in this game — including several stars on both teams — after also playing in the game won by Kansas City 31-20 in Miami following the 2019 season.  The Chiefs rallied from 10 points down in the fourth quarter to win that game and earn the first of two Super Bowl titles with Mahomes and coach Andy Reid at the helm. Kansas City also lost another and will be the third team to reach the championship game in four out of five seasons.  “We already have a pretty good idea how it’s going to look,” San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said. “They’ve been doing it a while. Since we met them in ’19, seems like they’ve been there every year since. We have been trying really hard to get back to this moment.”  Both teams have eight players on the active roster who played for them in the first meeting with Bosa joined by Deebo Samuel, George Kittle, Fred Warner, Dre Greenlaw, Arik Armstead, Kyle Juszczyk and Mitch Wishnowsky.  Mahomes will be joined by Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Harrison Butker, Mecole Hardman, James Winchester, Nick Allegretti and Blake Bell.  San Francisco also has cornerback Charvarius Ward, who was on the Chiefs team four years ago that beat the Niners, and injured tight end Ross Dwelley, who is on season-ending injured reserve.  The Chiefs have a former Niners player from that game in receiver Richie Hames, along with defensive lineman Derrick Nnadi on IR, and Austin Reiter and Mike Pennel on the practice squad.  Here's a look at the other times there was a Super Bowl rematch within five seasons of the first meeting.  GIANTS vs. PATRIOTS  Eli Manning and the Giants spoiled New England's bid for a perfect season in 2007 and then pulled off the upset again four years later.  The Patriots came into Super Bowl 42 with an 18-0 record and were on the brink of matching the perfect season of the 1972 Dolphins when Tom Brady threw a 6-yard TD pass to Randy Moss to make it 14-10 with 2:42 to go.  But Manning drive New York down the field — with help from David Tyree's helmet catch — and threw a game-winning TD to Plaxico Burress to stun New England.  Manning did it again in the 2011 season, driving to a game-winning touchdown with 57 seconds left for a 21-17 win.  COWBOYS vs. BILLS  Dallas and Buffalo had the only Super Bowl rematch in consecutive seasons, meeting at the end of the 1992 and 1993 campaigns.  The Cowboys got the best of both.  They used nine takeaways and four TD passes from Troy Aikman to hand the Bills a 52-17 loss in Super Bowl 27.  The rematch was far closer but had the same end result. James Washington returned a fumble for a TD early in the third quarter to tie the game and Emmitt Smith ran for two TDs in the second half for a 30-13 win.  STEELERS vs. COWBOYS  The Cowboys were on the wrong end of a Super Bowl rematch in the 1970s, losing to the Steelers following the 1975 and 1978 seasons.  Dallas became the first wild-card team to reach the title game in Super Bowl 10 thanks to a desperation pass to beat Minnesota and a blowout against the Rams.  But they fell short against the Steel Curtain in the second second-half comeback in Super Bowl history. Pittsburgh got a safety, two field goals and a 64-yard touchdown catch by Super Bowl MVP Lynn Swann in the fourth quarter of a 21-17 win to complete back-to-back titles for the Steelers.  Pittsburgh won again three years later in the first Super Bowl rematch ever to deny Dallas back-to-back championships.  MVP Terry Bradshaw threw four TD passes and Jackie Smith dropped a potential touchdown for Dallas. Roger Staubach's late rally fell short and the Steelers won their Super Bowl 35-31.  ___",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",The 49ers Take on the Chiefs in a Rare Super Bowl Rematch,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
2,https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2024-01-30/taking-it-easy-the-chiefs-are-back-in-the-super-bowl-because-of-a-simplified-offensive-approach,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — There was a moment back on Christmas Day, long before the Kansas City Chiefs could even start thinking about playing in the Super Bowl again, when Patrick Mahomes broke the huddle in a game against the Las Vegas Raiders.  His team was in total disarray. Players were coming off the sideline, then racing back, only to turn around and rush back onto the field. Nobody knew where to line up. And all the while, the play clock was quickly clicking down to zero.  That moment may have changed the course of the entire season for Kansas City.  In the midst of that deflating loss to the Raiders, their fifth in eight games, Chiefs coach Andy Reid and his offensive brain trust came to the realization that their famously complex offense had grown — well, too complex. There were too formations. Too many motions. Too many route concepts. In fact, there were too many words, often more than 15 to spit out a single play.  So the Chiefs simplified everything. And they haven't lost since.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  While their offense still may not be the juggernaut that carried the Chiefs to three previous Super Bowls in four years, it has at least become efficient, and that's all it needed to be alongside the league's No. 2 defense. The Chiefs gained more than 400 yards in a wild-card win over Miami, or more than 100 than they did that day against Las Vegas, and put up enough points against the Bills and Ravens on the road to earn a spot opposite the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11 — in Las Vegas, of all places.  “When you see some of the things that happened on tape, like that game where we had trouble getting in and out of the huddle, whether it's personnel or what we have in the play call — I think it is a combination of all that,"" Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said. ""So sometimes that stuff makes you look back and think, ‘What can we do different to help these guys out?’”  In some ways, the decision to pare back everything goes against common sense.  Shouldn't an offense that is more complex be more difficult to defend?  It also seemed to go against the instincts of both Reid and Mahomes, who relish designing creative plays and share the same go-for-broke attitude. When rookies show up to training camp each July, they are hit with the entirety of the offensive playbook, and it usually leaves their eyes spinning like slot machines and their brains feeling like mush.  “It's a complex offense. It's hard for young guys to do,” Mahomes admitted.  There are unusual formations. A wide range of personnel groups. Lots of shifts and movements, designed to both confuse the defense and provide a tell as to what it might do. There are ghost motions. And even when a wide receiver knows the route he is supposed to run, it could change mid-stride depending on what the secondary is doing.  No wonder the play calls themselves get long-winded. In fact, former quarterback Alex Smith used to warn his teammates in the huddle that he had “a doozy” so that they could pay attention as he delivered the entire word salad.  “There's so much verbiage in this playbook and so much dialogue,” Chiefs general manager Brett Veach acknowledged last fall, “and there's so many tweaks to every assignment in regard to where they align and how they look at coverage and how they alter routes. It's super complicated.”  Fast forward to Christmas Day. One of the problems the Chiefs had against the Raiders was the time it took to get plays into the game. Reid is usually calling them from the sideline, but it is Nagy whose radio is connected to Mahomes' helmet.  So, those long-winded plays were repeated four times: from Reid on the sideline to Nagy in the coaches' box, back to Mahomes on the field, and one last time to the rest of the team in the huddle. By the time they broke it and got to the line of scrimmage, there were just a few seconds left on the play clock and the Chiefs were rushing to get the snap off.  By simplifying things, the Chiefs have gotten to the line of scrimmage in the playoffs with 15 or 20 seconds on the clock, and that has given Mahomes time to survey the defense, change protections or audible to an entirely different play if necessary.  “Nobody took offense to any of it,” Nagy said. “We said, ‘How can we get better?’ And we started with that. There's a lot of other things that go into it, with execution and play design and everything, but put it all together and see what happens.”  What happened was back-to-back wins to clinch the AFC West and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. And three more wins there, including the past two on the road — the first road playoff games of Mahomes' career — when the decibel level inside the opposing stadium should make communication for an offense even more challenging.  “I don't like losing any games, so every loss I feel like is tough,"" Mahomes said, ""but we always had everything we wanted in front of us, and we had that mindset, and Coach Reid preaches that every day we come into the building. No one hung their head. Everybody was ready to go. And now, we're going to the Super Bowl, and like I've said, we're not done.""  ___",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Taking It Easy: the Chiefs Are Back in the Super Bowl Because of a Simplified Offensive Approach,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2024-01-30/resilient-u-s-boosts-imf-forecast-for-global-economic-growth,"The International Monetary Fund is joining the soft landing crowd, pointing in part to “greater-than-expected resilience” in the U.S. economy and fiscal support for China in raising its estimate of global growth going forward.  The global economic and development agency now predicts growth to hit 3.1% this year – an increase from 2.9% from its last projection in October – and 3.2% in 2025.    The forecast for the two-year period is still below the historical average for 2000 to 2019 but does acknowledge that inflation is falling faster than expected in most countries as central banks dial back on restrictive interest rate policies designed to reduce the higher prices that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Global inflation is expected to fall to 5.8% in 2024 and to 4.4% in 2025.    “The clouds are beginning to part,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, economic counselor and director of research at the IMF, wrote Tuesday on his blog . “The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up. But the pace of expansion remains slow, and turbulence may lie ahead.”  The improved outlook comes as economists in the U.S., including those at the Federal Reserve, are largely dismissive of the idea a recession is likely in 2024. The Fed is meeting this week to consider interest rate policy, with observers overwhelmingly expecting it to hold rates unchanged. Interest rate cuts are anticipated later this year.    That is not to say the global economy is without challenges. Principal among them are geopolitical risks from the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that could affect supply chains and energy resources.  Recent attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants on ships in the Red Sea are also a particular concern.  “The conflict poses a risk to global trade as the Suez Canal is a vital artery of global trade flows with around 15% of global trade and 25%-30% of global container shipments transiting through this waterway. It also raises concerns about a revival of global inflation pressures as importers face surging shipping costs,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon.  “For now, we don’t expect the situation in the Red Sea to substantially alter the outlook for global inflation and global monetary policy this year,” she added. “However, a prolonged conflict with shipping costs staying as high through 2024 could add up to 0.7 percentage points to global inflation this year.”    While the IMF projects overall global growth to hit 3.1% and 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, respectively, the organization also sees significant variances among countries. The U.S., with the world’s largest economy, should see 2.1% and 1.7% growth – down from an estimated 2.5% in 2023 but reflecting an upward revision of more than half a percentage point for 2024.  India , meanwhile, is projected to have growth of 6.5% in both 2024 and 2025, and China will grow by 4.6% and 4.1%. China’s rates also represent a decline from 2023 but an upward revision for 2024.  The European region is projected to grow by 0.9% and 1.7%, according to the IMF, while Russia will only see 1.1% growth in 2025. The Middle East and Central Asia can expect growth of 2.9% and 4.2%, with Saudi Arabia seeing 2.7% and 5.5% increases in its economy over the next two years.  The upward revisions to overall growth linked to developments in the U.S. and China underscore both the size of their economies and their influence. In the 2023 Best Countries analysis from U.S. News, survey respondents from around the world placed China at No. 1 and the U.S. at No. 2 for economic influence out of 87 countries.  At the same time, Gourinchas in his blog wrote that tight monetary policy was still expected to affect growth in the U.S., while “weaker consumption and investment continue to weigh on activity” in China.    “In the euro area, meanwhile, activity is expected to rebound slightly after a challenging 2023, when high energy prices and tight monetary policy restricted demand,” Gourinchas wrote. “Many other economies continue to show great resilience, with growth accelerating in Brazil , India, and Southeast Asia’s major economies.”  Eric LeCompte, executive director of the religious development organization Jubilee USA Network, also noted that many countries still face the twin concerns of dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic and crushing debt burdens.  “Most countries are facing economic challenges while their debt payments are too high,” he said ""When countries need resources and interest rates on loans are high, we have a recipe for more crises.""  LeCompte also stated that developing countries spend 13% of their budgets repaying debt, more than double the figure 15 years ago.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Resilient U.S. Boosts IMF Forecast for Global Economic Growth,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Plowman wrote Monday in a letter to Charlie Baker shortly after Tennessee officials met with NCAA representatives to discuss the allegations that it was “intellectually dishonest” considering that leaders of collegiate sports owe it to students and their families to act in their best interest with clear rules.  “Instead, 2 1/2 years of vague and contradictory NCAA memos, emails and ‘guidance’ about name, image and likeness (NIL) has created extraordinary chaos that student-athletes and institutions are struggling to navigate,” Plowman wrote in the letter. “In short, the NCAA is failing.”  Plowman wrote that she appreciated NCAA staff listening to Tennessee's arguments and agreeing to evaluate them. But she also called it “intellectually dishonest” for NCAA enforcement staff to pursue infractions cases as if students have no NIL rights or institutions are “willfully violating” a “clear and unchanging set of rules.""  The NCAA's policy is to refrain from commenting publicly about current, pending or potential investigations, with rare exceptions.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  While the NCAA lifted its ban on athletes profiting from their fame in 2021, the association still had in place an interim NIL policy that fell back on previous broad rules against using payments as recruiting inducements, pay-for-play and boosters being involved in recruiting of athletes. The NCAA issued several clarifications of the policy and guidance to members over the next 18 months, including identifying third-party entities promoting a school's athletic department as a booster.  The booster-funded NIL collective that supports Tennessee athletes, the Volunteer Club founded by Spyre Sports Group, was among the first and most well organized to emerge around the country after the NCAA lifted its ban on athletes making money off their fame. That included a deal with prized 2023 quarterback recruit Nico Iamaleava from California.  A person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Iamaleava's recruitment and NIL deal with Spyre was being scrutinized by NCAA investigators. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because details of the inquiry were not being made public.  Calls and text messages left for Spyre Group executives Hunter Baddour and James Clawson by the AP seeking comment were not immediately returned.  Plowman made it clear she wanted to talk to Baker in person, especially since the NCAA president recently testified before Congress about wanting to meet with as many members and athletes as possible about the issues surrounding college sports. She wrote the letter after her December request for Baker to meet with her and Tennessee athletic director Danny White was denied.  She said Tennessee worked well with the NCAA in a recent investigation, cooperation cited by the Division I Committee on Infractions as the standard for others to follow. Plowman wrote: “When we are wrong at the University of Tennessee, we admit it.""  Tennessee could be in danger of being treated a repeat violator by the NCAA, which could make any sanctions of penalties even more severe. Schools are subject to being deemed repeat violators if a Level I and II violation occurs within five years of a penalty being enacted from a previous case.  The NCAA fined Tennessee more than $8 million last July to cap an investigation started by the university in November 2020. The NCAA needed more than 80 pages in its report outlining more than 200 infractions during the three-year tenure of former football coach Jeremy Pruitt.  Tennessee was found guilty of committing 18 Level I violations — the most severe. Most involved recruiting infractions and direct payments to athletes and their families with benefits totaling approximately $60,000.  The head of the panel ruling on the investigation called the violations “egregious and expansive,” with Tennessee failing to monitor its football program.  Only Tennessee’s early cooperation with the NCAA kept the program from a postseason ban. Four former staffers were given show-cause orders, including one spanning six years for Pruitt, who was fired in January 2021.  “It is inconceivable that our institution’s leadership would be cited as an example of exemplary leadership in July 2023, then as a cautionary example of a lack of institutional control only six months later,” Plowman wrote in the letter.  The NCAA report last year found violations including at least 110 impermissible hotel room nights, 180 impermissible meals, 72 instances of providing impermissible entertainment or other benefits, 41 impermissible recruiting contacts, 37 instances of providing impermissible game-day parking and 14 times in which gear was impermissibly provided to prospects.  Tennessee just wrapped up a third season with coach Josh Heupel going 9-4. Iamaleava made his first career start in a 35-0 rout of Iowa in the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Day.  ___  AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Tennessee Chancellor Says NCAA Allegations of NIL Rules Violations Are Untrue and Flawed,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
6,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/harvard-mega-donor-ken-griffin-has-halted-donations-to-school,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Kenneth Griffin, who has donated more than half a billion dollars to Harvard University, has halted his giving to the school over how it handled antisemitism on campus and a broader leadership crisis involving its president.  Griffin, who started trading in his Harvard dormitory before becoming the most profitable hedge fund manager ever, told an audience at the Managed Funds Association conference in Miami on Tuesday that he stopped donations, for now.  ""No ... And I've made that clear to members of the corporate board,"" Griffin said when asked whether he was still supporting his alma mater financially.  Griffin made headlines in April 2023 by donating $300 million to Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, raising the total amount of his gifts to more than half a billion.  Months later students and alumni criticized Claudine Gay, who had been named Harvard's first black president in 2023, for her handling of demonstrations about the Israel-Hamas conflict and her testimony to Congress about the crisis. Allegations of plagiarism also mounted and Gay resigned earlier this month.  While other alumni, including hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who has given roughly $50 million to Harvard, publicly called for Gay to be removed, Griffin had made no public comments about Harvard before Tuesday.  ""Until Harvard makes it very clear that they're going to resume their role as educating young American men and women to be leaders, to be problem solvers, to take on difficult issues, I'm not interested in supporting the institution,"" Griffin said.  He left open the door to resuming his gifts but made clear changes need to be made in how the school pursues its mission.  Speaking more generally about America's elite universities, Griffin said: ""The real question is will (they) get back to their roots of educating American children, young adults, to be the future leaders of our country, or are they going to maintain being lost in the wilderness of microaggressions, a DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) agenda that seems to have no real end game, and just being lost in the wilderness?""  Griffin's Citadel invests $56 billion. In 2022, the firm posted an annual gain of $16 billion, making it the most successful hedge fund of all time, according to LCH Investments.  Harvard is the wealthiest university in the United States with a $50.7 billion endowment but alumni like Ackman have accused it of mismanaging the assets. Griffin's stance now suggests other mega donors may also slow or stop their giving at a time tuition for undergraduates hovers around $80,000 a year and critics say its fees are becoming unaffordable.

7,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/stock-market-today-asian-shares-are-mixed-with-chinese-shares-falling-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted through a quiet Tuesday and held near their record heights following a mixed set of profit reports.  The S&P 500 slipped 2.96 points, or 0.1%, from its record to 4,924.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 133.86, or 0.3%, to 38,467.31, and the Nasdaq composite fell 118.15, or 0.8%, to 15,509.90.  UPS slumped 8.2% even though it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of Wall Street’s estimates, and it also gave a forecast for full-year revenue in 2024 that was weaker than expected.  Whirlpool sank 6.6% despite likewise reporting a better profit than expected. Its forecast for 2024 revenue of $16.9 billion was roughly $1 billion below analysts’ estimates.  Helping to offset those losses was General Motors. The automaker jumped 7.8% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Treasury yields were also mixed in the bond market following reports that showed the economy remains stronger than expected. One said confidence among consumers is climbing, while another suggested the job market may be warmer than forecast.  U.S. employers advertised 9 million job openings at the end of December, which was a touch more than economists expected and slightly above November’s level. Traders were expecting the data to show a cooldown in the number of openings.  A drawdown would have fit more neatly into the trend that’s carried Wall Street to a record: a slowdown in the economy’s growth strong enough to keep a lid on inflation but not so much that it will create a recession.  Hopes for a continued such trend are what have Wall Street foaming about the possibility of several cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year. Cuts would mark a sharp turnaround from the Fed's dramatic hikes to rates over the last two years, and the reductions would give a boost to the economy and investment prices.  The Federal Reserve began its latest policy meeting on interest rates Tuesday, but virtually no one expects it to cut rates this soon. That won’t stop economists and traders from parsing every word coming out of the Fed Wednesday after its meeting finishes. They’ll be searching for clues that a rate cut may arrive at its next meeting in March.  “We think markets are overly optimistic that we’ll see a Fed interest rate cut in March,” said Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard. “It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates.”  The two-year Treasury yield, which moves closely with expectations for the Fed’s action, rose to 4.36% from 4.32% late Monday. It moved decisively higher following the release of the economic reports.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, fell to 4.04% from 4.09% late Monday.  After trading ended on Wall Street Tuesday, a pair of the market’s most influential stocks also reported their latest quarterly results.  As two of the largest stocks in the market by value, Microsoft and Alphabet have outsized sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes. They, along with five other Big Tech stocks, have accounted for the majority of the S&P 500’s torrid rally since hitting a bottom two Octobers ago.  Three more of the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech stocks will report their results on Thursday: Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms. They’ll also need to hit expectations to justify their massive leaps.  Companies that have reported better profits than expected so far this reporting have not been getting as big a pop as usual, analysts say.  JetBlue Airways sank 4.7% despite reporting a milder loss for the last three months of 2023 than analysts expected. It said it expects revenue to be roughly flat in 2024, while its cost pressures outside of fuel will likely rise.  In stock markets abroad, Chinese indexes slumped to tack more losses onto their already tough start to the year.  Shares in property developer China Evergrande Group, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate company, remained suspended from trading after a Hong Kong court ordered the liquidation of the company.  Other property companies led the decline in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index sank 2.3%. Stocks in Shanghai gave up 1.8%.  Chinese regulators have been moving to prop up the markets amid worries about the troubled property industry and disappointing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.  Stocks were mixed elsewhere in Asia and modestly higher in Europe.  ___  AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Stock Market Today: Wall Street Holds Near Its Record Heights,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

9,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/technology/best-portable-projectors,"Things To Consider When Buying a Portable Projector  Overall Design: A “lunchbox” design for a portable projector means it has a box-like shape with an integrated handle to easily carry it, while a “pico” projector will easily fit in a hand and is incredibly lightweight. There are also more rectangular-shaped projectors that have no handle but weigh under 12 pounds, which makes them easy to transport and set up. Choose the most convenient model, based on whether you’ll be moving the projector from room to room or packing it up to take on the road.  Resolution: While you can find extremely inexpensive projectors with 780p or lower resolution, we highly recommend choosing one with a minimum resolution of 1080p. That said, a 4K Ultra HD projector with support for HDR will provide a significantly better picture.  “A projector's resolution tells you how sharp the picture will look,"" explains Asher Weinstein, a Projection Specialist at ProjectorScreen.com . ""A 4K resolution image has four times more pixels than a 1080p image, so it showcases much greater detail.”  Brightness: A projector’s brightness is measured in ANSI lumens. If “ANSI” isn't listed by the manufacturer in conjunction with a projector’s brightness, it doesn't meet the standards of the American Standards Institute and will likely not be as bright as you’re being led to believe.  A very small or inexpensive portable projector usually won't be as bright as a larger and more expensive model. Anything less than 400 ANSI lumens will require the projector to be used in an extremely dark viewing area to achieve a bright picture that doesn't look washed out.  With all of this in mind, we recommend a brightness of 800 to 1,000 lumens for a portable projector and at least 2,000 to 3,000 lumens for a regular projector that will be used in a viewing space with ambient light.  Maximum Projection Size: Based on where you’ll be using the projector, select one with a projection size that can maximize that space and that will work with the screen you plan to use with it.  Connectivity Options: Most projectors offer a variety of wireless and wired options for connecting them to a computer or mobile device. Most can also stream content from the internet directly via Wi-Fi. The most common connectivity options are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI, and USB.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Best Portable Projectors of 2024 | U.S. News,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

1,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/technology/best-portable-projectors,"Things To Consider When Buying a Portable Projector  Overall Design: A “lunchbox” design for a portable projector means it has a box-like shape with an integrated handle to easily carry it, while a “pico” projector will easily fit in a hand and is incredibly lightweight. There are also more rectangular-shaped projectors that have no handle but weigh under 12 pounds, which makes them easy to transport and set up. Choose the most convenient model, based on whether you’ll be moving the projector from room to room or packing it up to take on the road.  Resolution: While you can find extremely inexpensive projectors with 780p or lower resolution, we highly recommend choosing one with a minimum resolution of 1080p. That said, a 4K Ultra HD projector with support for HDR will provide a significantly better picture.  “A projector's resolution tells you how sharp the picture will look,"" explains Asher Weinstein, a Projection Specialist at ProjectorScreen.com . ""A 4K resolution image has four times more pixels than a 1080p image, so it showcases much greater detail.”  Brightness: A projector’s brightness is measured in ANSI lumens. If “ANSI” isn't listed by the manufacturer in conjunction with a projector’s brightness, it doesn't meet the standards of the American Standards Institute and will likely not be as bright as you’re being led to believe.  A very small or inexpensive portable projector usually won't be as bright as a larger and more expensive model. Anything less than 400 ANSI lumens will require the projector to be used in an extremely dark viewing area to achieve a bright picture that doesn't look washed out.  With all of this in mind, we recommend a brightness of 800 to 1,000 lumens for a portable projector and at least 2,000 to 3,000 lumens for a regular projector that will be used in a viewing space with ambient light.  Maximum Projection Size: Based on where you’ll be using the projector, select one with a projection size that can maximize that space and that will work with the screen you plan to use with it.  Connectivity Options: Most projectors offer a variety of wireless and wired options for connecting them to a computer or mobile device. Most can also stream content from the internet directly via Wi-Fi. The most common connectivity options are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI, and USB.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Best Portable Projectors of 2024 | U.S. News,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

(AP) — A proposal to reduce the legal burden for proving private ownership of coastal marshlands first granted to Georgia settlers centuries ago was advanced Tuesday by a state House committee.  The House Judiciary Committee voted 6-5 to approve House Bill 370 during a meeting streamed online from the state Capitol in Atlanta, sending it to the full House. Prior versions of the proposal in 2022 and last year failed to get a vote on the House floor.  Conservation groups are opposing the measure, saying it would put thousands of acres of salt marsh currently considered public land at risk of being seized by people who don’t rightly own it.  Rep. Matt Reeves, R-Duluth, and several coastal lawmakers sponsoring the bill say it will encourage restoration of salt marsh that was long ago drained or damaged by farming and other uses.  “For 200 years, these rice farms and other manmade alterations in Georgia’s marshlands have not repaired themselves,” said Reeves, the Judiciary Committee's vice chair. ""Mother nature needs help to restore those marshlands. And this is the vehicle to do it.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The vast majority of Georgia's 400,000 acres (161,874 hectares) of coastal marshland is owned by the state and protected from development. State officials estimate about 36,000 acres (14,568 hectares) are privately owned through titles granted by England's king or Georgia's post-American Revolution governors during the 1700s and early 1800s.  Critics say the legal process for a landholder to trace ownership to one of these so-called “crown grants” is too cumbersome and can take a decade or longer. The state attorney general's office handles those cases now and requires evidence of continuous ownership from the original centuries-old grant to the present.  The measure before House lawmakers would establish a streamlined alternative for those who, if granted their claim of ownership, agree to keep their marsh in conservation. Owners would be allowed to sell mitigation credits to private developers looking to offset damage to wetlands elsewhere.  “We’re taking something the state has protected for centuries, and we’re putting it into private hands,” said Megan Desrosiers, president and CEO of the coastal Georgia conservation group One Hundred Miles. ""And then that person gets paid to protect something that the state has been protecting for centuries.”  Desrosiers and other opponents say the proposed changes also place an unfair burden on the state to disprove claims of private marsh ownership.  Cases taking the streamlined path would go to the State Properties Commission rather than the attorney general's office. The commission would have a deadline of nine months to resolve the case. If it takes longer, the person making the claim gets ownership of the marsh.  “The state has an obligation not to give away resources to private citizens,” Kevin Lang, an Athens attorney and opponent of the marshlands bill, told the committee at a Jan. 11 hearing. He said the proposal would ""result in people getting title to saltmarsh who never had a valid claim.”  Jerry Williams, whose family was granted marshland along the Ogeechee River in Savannah in the 1800s, told committee members at the prior hearing that state officials have abused the existing process for proving ownership.  “They throw everything at the wall that they can to try to delay, to muddy the waters and make it cost prohibitive for the private landowners to defend their title,” Williams said.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Bill to Make Proving Ownership of Georgia Marshland Less Burdensome Advanced by State House Panel,1 hour ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

U.S. officials said they are still determining which of several Iran-backed groups was responsible for the first killing of American troops in a wave of attacks against U.S. forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas assault on Israel. Biden plans to attend the dignified transfer to mark the fallen troops' return to American soil on Friday and answered in the affirmative when asked by reporters if he'd decided on a response, as he indicated he was aiming to prevent further escalation.  “I don’t think we need a wider war in the Middle East,"" Biden said at the White House before departing for a fundraising trip to Florida. “That’s not what I’m looking for.”  It was not immediately clear whether Biden meant he had decided on a specific retaliatory plan. A U.S. official told The Associated Press that the Pentagon is still assessing options to respond to the attack in Jordan.  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters traveling with Biden aboard Air Force One that he would not preview the U.S. response, but indicated it would come in phases.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “It’s very possible that what you’ll see is a tiered approach here, not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions over a period of time,"" he said.  Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah, one of several groups eyed by U.S. officials, announced Tuesday in a statement “the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government.”  The attacks on U.S. forces by Iraqi militias over the past four months have placed the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in an awkward position. Sudani was brought to power by Iranian-allied factions but has also attempted to stay in Washington’s good graces and has condemned the attacks on U.S. forces serving in Iraq as part of an international commission to fight the Islamic State. Iraqi and U.S. officials on Saturday opened talks aimed at winding down the commission’s presence.  Kirby said that Biden spoke with the soldiers' families Tuesday morning and extended his condolences, pledging full assistance to the families as they grieve.  In separate calls with the families, Biden also gauged their feelings about his attendance at Friday's dignified transfer of the fallen service members' remains at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday, and “all of them supported his presence there,” Kirby said.  “He was grateful for their time. He expressed to them how proud we all are of their service,"" Kirby said of Biden's calls with the families. “How we mourn and feel sorrow over their loss.”  Kirby added: “The president will be going to the dignified transfer on Friday.”  The solemn ceremony marks the return of fallen service members to American soil as they journey to their final resting place, with silent honor guards carrying flag-draped transfer cases holding the remains from transport aircraft to military vehicles.  The Pentagon identified those killed in the attack as Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Georgia; Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Georgia; and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Georgia. The Army Reserve announced on Tuesday that it had posthumously promoted Sanders and Moffett to the rank of sergeant.  There have been a total of 166 attacks on U.S. military installations since Oct. 18, including 67 in Iraq, 98 in Syria and now one in Jordan, a U.S. military official said. On Tuesday, Al-Asad Air Base in Western Iraq was targeted again by a single rocket, but there was no damage and no injuries in that attack, a U.S. military official said. The three soldiers killed in the Jordan strike were the first U.S. military fatalities in the Middle East since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out. One contractor has also died as the result of a heart attack after a strike on Al-Asad in December.  In 2021, Biden attended the dignified transfer of the remains of 13 troops killed in a suicide attack during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.  Separately, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany said it expected to receive 3 U.S. service members who were injured in the drone attack, including one listed in critical, but stable, condition. The Pentagon has said at least 34 troops were injured alongside the three killed in action.  —  Madhani reported from Jupiter, Fla. AP writers Lolita C.

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates,"By Stephen Nellis and Yuvraj Malik  (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp beat Wall Street estimates for fiscal second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as new artificial-intelligence features helped attract customers to its cloud and software services.  Microsoft shares were down 2% after-hours. The company, in collaboration with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, has pushed chatbots into its core products such as its Office software and Bing search engine over the past year, attracting business customers eager to try the tech industry's next breakthrough. Investor buzz over AI helped Microsoft's shares rise by 57% in 2023.  Its cloud-computing business - already the second-biggest behind that of Amazon.com - grew by nearly a third in the most recent quarter.  ""We've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,"" CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.""  Brett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president for investor relations, told Reuters that 6 percentage points of the growth rate of cloud-computing platform Azure in the second quarter was attributable to AI. That is double the 3 percentage points in the first quarter.  Investors are watching Microsoft's Azure and Office revenues to see what kind of sales flow comes from the tens of billions of dollars the company plans to pour into data centers this year to deliver generative AI.  Total revenue grew 18% to $62 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the average analyst estimate of $61.12 billion, according to LSEG data. Adjusted profit of $2.93 per share beat an average estimate of $2.78 per share.  Revenue at Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, grew 20% to $25.9 billion. Sales of Azure, for which Microsoft does not disclose a dollar figure, grew 30% - its best growth rate in four quarters - compared with a 27.7% consensus estimate from Visible Alpha, and outstripping a 25.7% growth in Google Cloud.  ""The software giant has delivered a healthy set of results, but not in a strong enough dose to appease the market,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  Sales at Microsoft's More Personal Computing segment, which includes its Windows operating system and gaming business, grew 19% to $16.9 billion, powered in part by the close of its $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard. Analysts had expected $16.8 billion.  Microsoft's Productivity and Business Process segment, which contains the LinkedIn social network in addition to Office sales, reported that sales rose 13% to $19.2 billion, just beating estimates.  AI-POWERED SURGE  While analysts have said that any meaningful gains from AI may not come before next year, investors have rewarded the company's push into AI and strategic partnership with Silicon Valley startup OpenAI.  In November, Microsoft started selling Copilot, an AI assistant that can summarize an email inbox or craft a slide show, for $30 per month, which analysts say is a premium price.  Early sales of the product showed up in the firm's commercial sales of Office software, where revenue grew 17%, compared with analyst expectations of commercial Office sales growth of 14.2%, according to data from Visible Alpha. Microsoft does not provide an absolute dollar figure for the sales.  Microsoft's Iversen said on Tuesday that Office's commercial offerings, where Copilot is being sold, now stand at 400 million paid seats, up from 382 million in April 2023.  The company's capital expenditures grew by $300 million from the previous quarter to $11.5 billion, putting the company on track to spend more than $46 billion this fiscal year.  ""That's a sign of the customer demand that we're seeing,"" Iversen said.  Microsoft's stock surge has helped it topple Apple as the world's most valuable listed company in the past few trading sessions. That was undented by a power struggle within OpenAI that highlighted the software giant's lack of direct control over its important partner. Microsoft also faces some legal and regulatory challenges.

5,https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-30/4-ways-biden-might-respond-to-the-drone-attack-in-jordan,"After the tragic death of three American service members in Jordan due to a drone attack by an Iran-backed Iraqi resistance group, President Joe Biden must respond. At one level, this tragedy is no shock; Iran-based groups – not even counting the Houthis, who are going after shipping in the Red Sea region – have attacked American forces in the region more than 100 times over the past several months. But since Americans died in this attack, a response is required.    The trick, however, is to respond in a way that leaves Iran with few natural next steps to escalate, and perhaps limited incentive to try. The last thing the U.S. needs is another war in the Middle East. And for all the trouble Iran creates, it has been known to date to avoid direct attacks on the United States and to attack American interests only indirectly, by proxy. None of that is to say that Iran is ruled by a bunch of nice guys. But Iran does its strategic calculations carefully, and we must too.  A quick review: Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran’s proxies have attacked the U.S. and its people many times, but with three notable cases: in Beirut in 1983, where Hezbollah killed 241 Marines on a single day; in Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, where 19 Americans perished and nearly 500 were injured; and in Iraq, during the years from 2003 on, where an estimated 600 U.S. service members were killed by Iranian-back groups (out of a total of some 4,500 American deaths overall).  So this is nothing new – yet it is also brand new, given current circumstances. It also comes after Iran has apparently been seeking retaliation against those in the chain of command when former President Donald Trump understandably ordered the killing of the terror mastermind Qassem Soleimani in early 2020.    Top Cartoons on the Democratic Party View All 128 Images  Biden said early Tuesday he has reached a decision about how to respond, but offered no further details. I would sketch out the options in roughly this way:    Damage Iran’s oil economy, either by disabling some oil tankers or damaging infrastructure in Iranian ports needed to load up ships with oil or gas. Done minimally at first, this signals to Iran that we are now prepared to strike them directly without taking big risks of civilian deaths and without necessitating a big attack all at once. In fact, we need not even acknowledge our role.  Strike isolated command posts in the region for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or Quds Force, Iranian state security forces, at places where we know Iranian operatives are present. Syria might be the best place for such an attack, given that the country remains a Wild West territory of sorts, and since we have no relationship to protect with the government there.  Start to share intelligence with more governments around the world about what Iran is doing in the region. The goal of such a move would be to reestablish maximally punitive sanctions on Iran at a time when some governments in Europe and Asia have resumed trade with the nation (as they were allowed to do under the 2015 nuclear deal – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – that the United States has abandoned even as most others have not).  Sink Iranian ships or destroy isolated aircraft at remote airfields. This approach, too, can be started small, with the implication that it could expand if Iran retaliates against us.  All of these options are worthy of consideration. The quality of target sets should factor into any decision, as should estimates of likely civilian casualties. However, I do not have enough information about either to feel confident in offering a specific recommendation.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",4 Ways Biden Might Respond to the Drone Attack in Jordan,3 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

7,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/services/home-warranty/idaho,"How To Choose a Home Warranty Company in Idaho  Idaho homeowners have many options when it comes to home warranty providers. Knowing how to narrow down the selection isn't always easy. Here are three straightforward steps to help you find the right home warranty for your needs.  1. Figure out if a home warranty is necessary. Before you shell out the cash for a home warranty, verify that it's worth it. If you've recently bought a new house, there may be a warranty already in place; check the terms of your sales agreement. If you're renting your apartment or house, the landlord may already have a warranty agreement. Another instance in which a home warranty may be unnecessary is if you've recently purchased new appliances or systems, which may have their own individual warranties.  2. Determine what appliances and systems require coverage. Create a list of all your home appliances and systems, noting which (if any) are under warranty already. You may want coverage for the remaining items. Make sure to consider systems and appliances outside the house as well, like an extra refrigerator in the garage or a guest house. You can then use your list of appliances and systems to shop around and find a tailor-made plan that fits your needs.  3. Start shopping around. Once you know what items require coverage, you can start looking at different providers and the plans they offer. Keep in mind that you may need to create a personalized plan – for instance, you can select a base plan and then cherry-pick individual extras to add to it. Read the terms and conditions of any plan you're considering and ask the company for a sample contract before signing. When reviewing the details, check service times, guarantees (workmanship and parts), and cancellation terms.",,[],Best Home Warranty Companies in Idaho,7 hours ago,USA,
8,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/services/home-warranty/washington,"How To Choose a Home Warranty Company in Washington  Start by reviewing all your warranties and insurance policies to be sure you actually need a home warranty. If you’re in a new home, your entire house should be covered for two years by the builder, but that warranty applies to the structure of the house, not to the systems or appliances.  Brand-new systems and appliances should also be covered. If you’re in an older home, you may have less existing coverage. Remember that home insurance policies don’t cover things like mechanical failures or problems due to wear and tear.  Once you’ve determined that you do want a home warranty, consider the type of coverage that’s best for you. For example, in a wet climate like Washington, you might be most concerned about coverage for roof leaks and sump pumps. If you’re in an older home, you might want to choose a company that covers preexisting conditions. Look carefully at available plans and add-ons, double-check the fine print of sample contracts, and note any exclusions that may impact your ability to make use of the warranty you’ve purchased.  After narrowing down your options, get in touch with the companies that interest you and ask for a quote. Be sure to ask any questions you have before signing up. For example, know how much service calls will cost you, how quickly technicians should show up, and to what degree the company guarantees repairs.",,[],Home Warranty Companies in Washington,7 hours ago,USA,

Home warranty costs depend on many factors, including provider, location, and the extent of coverage offered. Usually, the more appliances and systems a plan covers, the more expensive it will be. If you have a larger house with more appliances and systems requiring coverage, you may end up paying more.  To get an idea of the average home warranty prices in Kansas, we looked at the base costs of various plans from multiple providers. Our data revealed that the average cost of a Kansas home warranty plan is $56.66 per month. That said, the plan prices we found covered a broad range, from as low as $29.99 per month to $89.99 per month (both with American Home Shield).  You may be able to save money on your home warranty by signing up for an annual plan. Across the providers in our rating, we found that the monthly rate for a year-long plan is sometimes less than the monthly rate of a pay-by-the-month plan.",,[],Best Home Warranty Companies in Kansas,7 hours ago,USA,

A total of 47,592 Tesla vehicles were registered in California in the fourth quarter, compared with 52,782 a year earlier, according to data from California New Car Dealers Association.  The last time Tesla posted a year-on-year registration fall in California was the third quarter of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. California accounts for about 10% of Tesla's global deliveries.  Globally, Tesla saw its sales hit another record in the fourth quarter after the company cut prices. CEO Elon Musk has blamed high interest rates for raising monthly payments and in turn hurting demand for his company's EVs, forcing Tesla to slash prices.  Analysts said Musk may have alienated many potential buyers with actions and comments, including his endorsement of antisemitic comments on X and his support of the Republican Party. He later said he is ""far from being antisemitic.""  ""83% of Americans connect Musk with Tesla and that's a problem for Tesla considering that Musk’s reputation is much weaker than Tesla’s,"" Shahar Silbershatz, CEO of stakeholder intelligence firm Caliber, said, adding that it has seen a decline both in the reputation and the consideration rates for Tesla since Musk has acquired X, formerly Twitter, more than a year ago.  Tesla's price cuts also hit the value of Teslas out on the road, which may also dissuade some potential customers, especially since many Tesla owners are repeat buyers, Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said.  ""The poor residuals have probably left a lot of owners underwater on existing loans,"" he said.  Ongoing layoffs at tech companies located in California also may have weighed on consumer sentiment, they said.  Competition is also growing from the likes of Chevrolet , Hyundai , Mercedes-Benz and BMW , which all increased their EV market share in California last year.  During the full year of 2023, Tesla increased vehicle sales by 24.6% but lost battery market share by 10.5 percentage points, to 60.5% of EVs registered in California. Its share of the overall California car and light vehicle market rose slightly to 13%.  Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 were the top selling light truck and sedan in California for the year, respectively, by wide margins.  Consumers in California have been gravitating towards less expensive hybrid vehicles, which can run on gasoline and electric power.  Market share of vehicles with that powertrain type in California jumped to 13.3% in the fourth quarter, compared with 8.7% a year earlier.  The market share of battery electric vehicles in the state also fell to 21.1% in the fourth quarter from 22.3% in the prior three month period.

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/slip-sliding-away-shield-yourself-from-winter-injury,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A white winter landscape might look magical, but the cold and snow and ice can make even the simplest of tasks potentially dangerous.  “It’s slip and fall season,” said Dr. Letitia Bradford, an orthopedic surgeon who practices in rural communities in New Mexico and California. “We see a lot of ankle and wrist fractures during this time as people are slipping on water when it’s raining and ice spots or snow in colder areas.”  Orthopedic surgeons with the American College of Surgeons (ACS) have some important tips for getting through the winter safe and injury-free:  Slow down  People who are cautious and mindful of conditions around them are less likely to slip and fall, Bradford said.  “The thing that I tell people the most is to really take their time when doing something. Most of the time, injuries like slips and falls happen when you’re in a hurry,” Bradford said.  People should move slowly and deliberately and keep an eye out for hazards like puddles, black ice and snow-hidden curbs when walking about, especially when carrying things like grocery bags that obstruct your view of the ground.  “You can’t always watch out for ice spots because they do sneak up on you sometimes, but try to be wary of them when walking,” Bradford said. “Taking your time really is the key to a lot of injury prevention.”  Pick the right footwear  Shoes or boots with proper grip and good traction are essential for winter walking, even when completing short tasks outside.  People who must go out in treacherous conditions might consider adding traction devices like ice cleats or ice grips to their footwear, Bradford said.  “And if you are older and need to use a cane or walker, I cannot stress to you enough the importance of using that cane or walker in these times because it gives you an extra point of fixation and support on the ground,” Bradford said.  Keep your core strong  Winter often demands people use muscles that are otherwise neglected, whether they are shoveling snow, pushing a stuck car or clearing tree limbs broken by ice or snow.  “A lot of people can aggravate their backs and muscles from overusing muscles that they don’t normally use,” Dr. Todd Albert, surgeon-in-chief emeritus at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, said in an ACS news release. “We see strain injuries from that kind of overuse.”  To ward these injuries off, consider exercising the core year-round by engaging in a mix of aerobics and strength training classes at lease three times a week.  A strong core trained by yoga or Pilates in particular can act as a brace to protect against serious injury.  “I think doing all of those things together will both increase your bone density and balance to protect against injuries that occur more often in the winter,” Albert said.  Know your limits  Many folks take pride in their prowess at winter sports like skiing or snowboarding, but these high-impact activities can be dangerous if a person overestimates their skills.  Albert has become a “ballroom skier” these days, trading in black diamond runs for less risky ski trails.  “If you’re a skier and you’re 40 years old, don’t think you can ski like you did when you were 20 years old,” Albert said.  This extends to chores around the home as well -- even taking out the trash can lead to an injury if a person falls.  “Any kind of rotational injury can cause skeletal injuries,” said Dr. Brad Yoo, an associate professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Yale School of Medicine. “There are a myriad of injuries that can occur due to slips and falls, so try to be very cognizant and conscious of what kind of surface and terrain you’re on.”  Yoo also urges people to reach out to their doctor promptly if they can’t tell how badly they’ve been injured in a fall, particularly if over-the-counter pain relievers aren’t easing the swelling and pain.  “If the suspicion is there, you should seek care. You don’t want to delay your care for four or five days thinking it’s nothing,” Yoo said. “Orthopaedic injuries are easier to manage if the problem is dealt with urgently.”  Watch out for your neighbors  Small acts of kindness can make a big impact on those around you, especially if extended snowstorms lead to heavy loads of snow compacting and turning into ice.  “If there are people near you who can’t get out of their house because they’re older or have other issues, be a good neighbor and clear their snow if you can,” said Dr. Bryant Oliphant, an orthopaedic surgeon at Detroit Receiving Hospital.  “People aren’t necessarily aware of ice or other slick spots when they’re going for a walk, so if you’re aware and can maintain your sidewalks and roads, I think that goes a long way to helping other people out,” Oliphant added.  Seniors in particular could use the help to avoid a “game-changing” injury, Oliphant said.  “You’re doing fine, and all of a sudden, you break your hip, wrist or ankle,” Oliphant said. “That can ruin your winter and change things, especially if you’re elderly. It can be very hard to recover from these types of injuries.”  More information  Ohio State University has more about winter safety.

5,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/chita-rivera-west-side-story-broadway-star-dead-at-91,"By Patricia Reaney  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chita Rivera, the musical theater legend and multiple Tony winner who created the role of Puerto Rican firebrand Anita on Broadway in ""West Side Story"" and other memorable characters, has died at the age of 91.  The petite, raven-haired dancer, singer and actress made history when she became the first Hispanic woman to receive a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor in 2002. She also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2009.  ""It is with great sadness that Lisa Mordente, the daughter of Chita Rivera, announces the death of her beloved mother who died peacefully on Tuesday, January 30, 2024 in New York after a brief illness,"" her daughter Lisa said in a statement.  Rivera was nominated for 10 Tony awards and won twice. She also received a special Tony for Lifetime Achievement in 2018 for a career that spanned nearly seven decades.  Celebrated playwright Terrence McNally, who wrote the book for Rivera's Tony-winning roles in ""The Rink"" opposite Liza Minnelli in 1984 and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" a decade later, described her as ""a walking history book of the golden age of American musical theater.""  From the chorus in 1950s Broadway musicals ""Guys and Dolls"" and ""Can-Can,"" Rivera moved to center stage as murderess Velma Kelly in the original 1975 Broadway production of ""Chicago"" and created the role of Rose in the surprise hit ""Bye, Bye Birdie"" with Dick Van Dyke in 1960.  But it was her portrayal of the sassy, hip-swaying Anita sashaying across the stage singing ""America"" or warning her friend about ""A Boy Like That"" in ""West Side Story"" that made Rivera a star.  ""To be there when those geniuses created that show was something that is a blessing, you know. It's something that you can never, ever forget,"" Rivera once said about the groundbreaking musical by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.  NOBODY LIKE CHITA  ""When she let those limbs loose she was a one-woman showstopper and every choreographer wanted her,"" award-winning producer and director Harold Prince once said. ""There is nobody who can dance, sing and act like Chita Rivera.""  Rivera was born Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero on Jan. 23, 1933 in Washington, D.C. Her father, Puerto Rican musician Pedro Julio Figueroa del Rivero, died when she was 7.  One of five children, she studied ballet from a young age and won a scholarship to George Balanchine's School of American Ballet in New York. She was still a teenager when, on a whim, she auditioned with a friend for the touring company of the musical ""Call Me Madam"" and landed a role.  ""I always tell kids today never to look down on the chorus and working there,"" Rivera said in an interview with the website thestage.co.uk in 2015. ""It's an extraordinary place to be – you will learn everything you will eventually have to do.""  In 1957 she married Tony Mordente, an actor and dancer in the show. She was such an integral part of ""West Side Story"" that its London production had to be delayed until after she gave birth to her only child, Lisa, in 1958.  Rivera's career was interrupted in 1986 when she suffered a compound leg fracture in a car accident in New York while appearing in ""Jerry's Girls."" Doctors had to insert many pins to repair her shattered limb.  ""Just like the movies, they told me I would never dance again,"" she told Variety in 2005. ""And just like the movies, here I am I don't know how many performances later.""  REBOUND  After rigorous physical therapy Rivera not only recovered from the accident but went on to win her second Tony for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" in 1993 and scored another nomination for ""Nine,"" opposite Antonio Banderas, a decade later.  Rivera also appeared regularly on TV entertainment shows and was in the film version of ""Sweet Charity"" in 1969 with Shirley MacLaine and ""Chicago"" in 2002.  In her mid-70s, when other dancers had slowed down or retired, she starred in ""Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life,"" a stage show that combined music, dance and storytelling.  ""This bona fide Broadway icon ... looks as fit as a well-tuned fiddle,"" Time Out magazine said in its 2005 review of the show.  A decade later, Rivera appeared in a PBS television retrospective of her career called ""Chita Rivera: A Lot of Livin' To Do."" The same year she earned her 10th Tony nomination as a revenge-seeking millionaire in the musical ""The Visit."" It was the last of several collaborations with the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Webb.  ""You really never know what the next day brings you,"" Rivera told the senior advocacy group AARP in a 2011 interview. ""I have a very young outlook. I don't think you know how much you can do until you try.""

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2024-01-30/movie-review-in-how-to-have-sex-the-party-suddenly-stops-being-fun,"For women of a certain age who grew up being told that if they wore the wrong thing, drank a little too much, or gave the wrong signals that they were “asking for it,” it might seem like the youths of today have it good, or at least quite a bit better. Consent seems to matter. Clothing coverage does not. Victims are listened to, sometimes at least.  And yet for all the freedom and exhibitionism and sexual liberation that might be projected on social media, teens are still teens and people are still people and things still happen, casually and in quietly catastrophic grey areas. These are truths that are conveyed powerfully in “How to Have Sex,” a stylish, assured and moving debut from writer-director Molly Manning Walker that opens in North American theaters on Friday.  “How to Have Sex” is not didactic, however, which is what makes it so effective. It’s just a story about a girl, Tara (Mia McKenna-Bruce) and her two friends, Em (Enva Lewis) and Skye (Lara Peake) on holiday at a party resort in Greece. They’re looking to drink and dance, wear neon bustiers and bathing suits and complicated mesh coverups and meet some guys. Ideally some “fit” ones. And it starts out so fun, like a more innocent and realistic “Spring Breakers.”  Parties on screen rarely feel as fun as they’re supposed to — the joy often looks a little forced. But Walker somehow makes you feel like you’re actually there and kind of loving it, regardless of whether you were the “MTV Beach House” or “Love Island” type, even as a voyeuristic exercise. Much of that energy comes from the three friends, immediately believable as such, charismatic and adorable as they squeal about a very unremarkable hotel room being “luxury.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Some guys enter the picture soon too, just one balcony over (“Romeo, Romeo where is you?” one character coos). Badger (Shaun Thomas), the guy who catcalls Tara, is probably not many girls’ idea of a Romeo at least on first sight. His hair is badly bleached — a kind of '90s boyband look. He’s got a neck tattoo with a red pout and “Hot Legends” scrawled underneath it. This is not boyfriend material or even hookup material, right?  And yet there’s an immediately sweet chemistry between him and Tara, who are both posturing as too-cool party people down for any number of humiliating public spectacles, but probably would just rather spend a night in on the couch with each other. In any event, a flirt-ship is born, but other pressures of youthful wildness abound.  Tara, we come to find, is a virgin. This is something Skye makes her feel self-conscious about while also trying to push her to get rid of on the trip. This rite-of-passage has fueled any number of teen comedies over the years, often from the horny boys’ point of view. But the lightheartedness, even in the not-rapey ones, can deny and diminish a reality that its not such a simple thing for either gender.  “How to Have Sex” is partly a movie about trust, knowing who to trust and how to trust yourself but also how to regain that after something traumatic like sexual assault. Badger’s friend Paddy (Samuel Bottomley) does not seem all that different from him, but his vibe is oh so subtly off. Who can discern that at 16 with people you’ve just met? Skye, similarly, seems like she has Tara’s best interests in mind, but this is also a friendship that she’s too naïve to know is not a healthy one.  There is a hard turning point when things stop being fun in “How to Have Sex,” when one morning Tara is missing from both hotel rooms. Some are concerned. Some are not. One person thinks its funny. She comes back and her night is recreated for the audience, but Tara is changed — a shell of the vibrant person she was just a few hours prior unsure of what she’s feeling, if it’s valid and if anyone would care.  Walker often lets the camera linger on McKenna-Bruce’s face and eyes that convey all the things she can’t find the words for. It is a shattering performance and made all the more devastating because it’s so subtle, without big tears or smashing of mirrors or anything theatrical. Tara just slinks away into a depressive state that barely anyone notices. Her vacation, and life, has turned into a nightmare; Everyone else is still having fun.  “How to Have Sex,” a MUBI release in select North American theaters Friday, has not been rated by the Motion Picture Association.

A new poll from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 62% of U.S. Asians and Pacific Islanders say their household's financial situation is good, slightly higher than the 54% of all U.S. adults who said that in an October AP-NORC poll. But only about one-quarter of Asian American and Pacific Islander adults are extremely or very confident they would be able to pay for a sudden medical expense. That is in sync with 26% of U.S. adults overall. Meanwhile, 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.  When it comes to the ability to maintain household expenses, only 3 in 10 AAPI adults are highly confident they can do so. An additional 46% are “somewhat confident” and 23% have “little to no confidence.”  Stan Kilpatrick, a 65-year-old Republican in Altadena, California, runs a limo service. His client base, which includes the University of Southern California, has gone down because more events and meetings with guest speakers and groups are happening virtually. Meanwhile, the cost of auto insurance and fuel continues to rise.  “Much of the money that I was saving for retirement has gone into the day-to-day expenses as the business has gone down,” said Kilpatrick, who is half Chinese. He also has a 23-year-old daughter living at home and is “absolutely terrified"" because of what things cost right now. I feel for her because if you’re just starting out, it’s like you really are stuck in the land of the roommate.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  He is somewhat confident he could weather an unforeseen payment like a health-related need. But that is only because of the health insurance coverage he has as an Army veteran.  “They’re able to spread the cost. So, that does help but ultimately out of pocket, I’m not necessarily sure that the Veterans Administration will be there for me,” Kilpatrick said.  Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, said concerns about health costs and medical debt are clearly high priorities in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. There are more multi-generational AAPI households compared to the U.S. average, and these households are more likely to include foreign-born grandparents who don't qualify for Medicare.  The weight of medical costs is emotional too, Ramakrishnan said.  “There is just the sense of familial obligation that tends to be fairly high in many Asian, Asian American cultures,” he said. “You look at a population that on average has higher incomes, but they’re not much more likely than the U.S. average to say that they’ll have enough savings for retirement — 22% versus 18%.”  When it comes to the nation's economy as a whole, 65% of AAPI adults characterize it as at least somewhat poor. That aligns with 69% of the general U.S. adult population in a December AP-NORC poll. Furthermore, about 4 in 10 AAPI adults believe the economy will only get worse in the next year. Only about 2 in 10 think it will actually improve. But they mostly follow party lines when it comes to how President Joe Biden is handling the economy, inflation, jobs and student debt.  About half identified as Democrats, about one-quarter as Republicans and 2 in 10 as independents.  About 4 in 10 AAPI adults expressed approval with how Biden is handling the economy. But only 34% of U.S. adults approve of his performance on the economy. A majority of AAPI adults — 55% — approve of how Biden is handling jobs. Only 32% approve of how he is dealing with cost inflation. On student debt, 45% approve of him. That is on par with the 41% of U.S. adults overall who approved in the October poll.  Audrey Jackson-Post, 34, of Kirksville, Missouri, said her household's financial situation has been difficult. Sometimes she stresses out over paying basic expenses. She and her husband recently fell short of buying a house. Jackson-Post, who is part Korean, only has part-time hours in the kitchen of the school where her husband works in the classroom full-time.  A Democrat, Jackson-Post is not sure if she will vote for Biden in the presidential election.  “Since he’s been in office, it’s been harder for everyone to get jobs. It just feels like everything’s harder,” she said. “My situation’s not great, but if the housing market isn’t the way it is, I would have been able to get a different house.”  James Bae, 49 and a married business consultant in Temecula, California, said his household income is lower compared to a year ago. The number of companies willing to pay for his services fluctuates with the state of the economy. Meanwhile, household expenses have risen. Bae, who is Korean American and unaffiliated with a political party, recently went back to school for his Ph.D. Plus, he and his wife have two teenage sons.  “They eat a lot, they’re getting more active. Certainly, I'm glad they’re great and they're getting more involved in activities but it costs more,” Bae said.  At the same time, he believes the country's economy is moving in the right direction. He pointed to the Biden administration trying to foster more technology and manufacturing in the U.S. as well as financial assistance during the pandemic. He also acknowledges inflation is “a tough needle to thread.”  “If I had the trade-off with the state of employment and the way the economy is, I’d rather have the problems we have now with inflation rather than a recession,” Bae said.  He worries that the outcome of this year's presidential election could badly disrupt things.  “Building the infrastructure for a developing future economy takes time,” Bae said. “If the administration changes over, I suspect a lot of those things will be stopped and curtailed.”  __  The poll of 1,091 U.S. adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted Dec. 4-11, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population.

8,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/what-californias-atmospheric-rivers-means-for-water-snowpack-levels,"(Reuters) - The first of two atmospheric rivers over the next two weeks was expected to pound California on Wednesday and Thursday with heavy downpours or snow, which could cause dangerous flash flooding, landslides and white-out conditions.  WHAT IS A ATMOSPHERIC RIVER?  An atmospheric river is vast airborne current of dense moisture carried aloft for hundreds of miles from the Pacific and funneled over land to fall as bouts of heavy rain and snow.  It can appear as a trail of wispy clouds that can stretch for hundreds of miles.  Some atmospheric rivers are weak weather systems that bring beneficial rain or snows that feed water supplies and are a crucial element to the global water cycle.  WHAT ARE THE CURRENT WATER, SNOWPACK LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA?  The heavy rains and snow are welcome in California, which has experienced below average precipitation since the beginning of October. The state has received 9.81 inches of precipitation over that time, about 82% of its historic average, according to the California Water Watch.  Major reservoir levels in California are 116% above their average levels, but snowpack across the state is only 32% of its average, according to California Water Watch. More specifically, snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains is well below average, while to the north around Mount Shasta it is closer to average.  Reservoirs and melting snowpack help offset arid conditions during drier months.  HOW COMMON ARE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS?  These ""rivers in the sky"" are relatively common, with about 11 present on Earth at any time, according to NASA.  Most atmospheric rivers are weak and do not cause damage. In fact, they can provide much needed rain or snow.  HOW BIG ARE THEY AND CAN THEY BE DANGEROUS?  Atmospheric rivers can carry up to 15 times the volume of the Mississippi River, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The atmospheric river is expected to douse California on Wednesday and Thursday with heavy rains of up to 6 inches (15 cm) that could cause flash flooding and wash out roadways. Wind gusts may take down trees and powerlines, causing power outages, the National Weather Service said.  Some high-elevation areas could see heavy snows of up to 3 feet (91 cm) that may cause dangerous whiteout conditions on roadways, the service said.  Last winter, a series of a dozen atmospheric rivers drenched the state, causing urban flooding, landslides and road closures. Some 21 people were killed in the storms that caused, according to researchers at the Stanford University, more than $3 billion in losses.  The bountiful rainfall triggered considerable growth in grasses and scrub and contributed to a less potent wildfire season in 2023 than in previous recent years. Heavy rains, however, can create dangers around burn scars from previous wildfires. The denuded land becomes susceptible to mudslides.  In 2019, an atmospheric river nicknamed the ""Pineapple Express"" hit California. The water vapor from near Hawaii brought rain and triggered mudslides that forced motorists to swim for their lives and sent homes sliding downhill.  WHAT IMPACT WILL CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE ON THEM?  Atmospheric rivers that drenched California and flooded British Columbia in recent years will become larger — and possibly more destructive — because of climate change, scientists have said.  They will also become more frequent and more likely to arrive as part of series, causing up to four times more economic damage than they would have individually, a study in Science Advances said.  IS CALIFORNIA FREE OF DROUGHT?  The U.S. Drought Monitor, an initiative of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, shows small portions of northern and southeastern California are currently ""abnormally"" dry. From the beginning of 2020 until 2023, the state experienced periods of ""extreme"" and ""exceptional"" drought, according to the monitor.  Experts warn that California and the West have not escaped longer-term conditions that, according to a study by Nature Climate Change, created the region's driest 22-year span in 12 centuries during the period of 2000 to 2021.

9,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/memphis-officials-release-hours-of-more-video-in-fatal-police-beating-of-tyre-nichols,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — About 21 hours of newly released video and audio are revealing more about what first responders including the five fired police officers charged in the violent beating death of Tyre Nichols did and said the night Nichols was pulled over and mortally injured.  The dozens of recordings were made public Tuesday by Memphis city officials based on a state judge's order, which came down the same day that former officer Desmond Mills Jr. pleaded guilty in November to federal charges in the case that sparked outrage around the world and intensified calls for police reform. City officials also plan to release additional written documents in two weeks.  Mills also intends to plead guilty in state court and could testify against his four ex-colleagues — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith — who remain charged with civil rights violations in federal court and second-degree murder and other offenses in state court. They have pleaded not guilty.  The recordings released Tuesday add hours of context to the police video released weeks after the traffic stop, which showed the five officers beating Nichols as he yelled for his mother, steps from his house. The new material shows what officers and others did and said before, during and after the beating.  Much of their comments suggest officers and paramedics appeared fixated with the idea that he was high on drugs. Medics administered Naloxone to reverse a potential opioid overdose as Nichols slouched, unresponsive, after officers propped him up against a car. One emergency medical technician even claimed, “He’s not injured. He’s just high.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Nichols' autopsy later detected only low levels of alcohol and THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in his system.  As for what prompted the traffic stop, Bean’s bodycam recorded another officer saying that Nichols “drove into oncoming traffic” and “swerved like he’s going to hit my car” after they turned on sirens and ordered him to stop. But the same officer also said Nichols “stopped at the red light and put his turn signal on.”  The officer said they got out to pursue him and that's apparently when Nichols fled on foot towards his home, to where the beating would occur, less than a block from his front door.  Other officers recorded themselves saying Nichols had tried to grab an officer's gun, which none of the videos clearly show, and that he resisted arrest, even though Nichols appeared to be complying with their commands.  Later, some officers appeared perplexed that no drugs were in the car Nichols was driving. One suggested he could have thrown something while he was running.  Mills' body camera also recorded how he and his superior officer spoke to Nichols' mother and stepfather. When the stepfather answered the door and asked what Nichols is in custody for, Lt. Dewayne Smith appeared not to know until Mills said “DUI.” Then the lieutenant repeated “DUI.”  The police chief later said the department couldn't substantiate any reason for the traffic stop.  “I’m trying to find out if you know him to take any kind of drugs or narcotics or anything,” the lieutenant said. When Nichols’ mother, RowVaughn Wells, answered “no,” he said, “because he appeared to be on something other than alcohol.”  Wells then said Nichols smokes a little marijuana, and Lt. Smith responded: “He on something more than marijuana.”  Wells then tried repeatedly to learn where her son was, but the lieutenant was evasive, saying he is “with the paramedics” and “they got him a little ways from here” and “he’s in the neighborhood.” Finally he told her, “He’s going to go to jail after he gets some medical treatment.”  As they walked away, Mills told the lieutenant he believed the parents “know more than what they are saying” and seemed suspicious because they didn’t open their screen door. Then he said, “I just hope ... he just needs to make it, that’s all. He needs to make it. He ain’t looking too good.”  Dewayne Smith, who is not facing criminal charges, retired before police would have fired him.  About an hour after officers pulled Nichols from his car, a woman saying she was Nichols’ mother showed up, along with another man, at the intersection of the initial traffic stop and started asking Officer Preston Hemphill what happened.  When Hemphill said Nichols fought with officers, the mother sounded incredulous.  “My son? Not Tyre,” she said, later adding, “That don’t sound like my son. I’m sorry, sir.”  Hemphill fired his stun gun during the traffic stop but didn't follow Nichols to where other officers pummeled him. Hemphill was fired but isn't facing criminal charges.  Attorneys for Nichols’ family said they are reviewing the additional video, but expect it will “affirm what we have said from day one: that there was absolutely no justification for the officers’ brutal and inhumane actions.”  “We will continue our unflinching look at this tragedy and stand strongly with Tyre’s family in their continued grief and fight for justice,” attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a news release.  The Associated Press requested comments from attorneys for the former officers facing charges. Attorneys for Mills and Justin Smith declined to comment.  Nichols died in a hospital Jan. 10, 2023 three days after he was kicked, punched and hit with a police baton.  Nichols was Black. The five officers also are Black. The four who remain charged face federal trial in May and state court trial in August.  Following the January 2023 release of police body camera and pole camera footage, the city had planned to release about 20 more hours of video, audio and documents including the officers' personnel files, but the judge granted the defense's motion for a delay “until such time as the state and the defendants have reviewed this information.”  A coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, cited the First Amendment in pressing to have them made public. Lawyers for the former officers argued that their rights to a fair trial must be recognized and protected.  The U.S. Department of Justice opened a “patterns and practices” investigation into how Memphis Police Department officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing.  In March, the Justice Department announced a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units in the Memphis Police Department. Also, Nichols' mother has sued the city and its police chief over her son’s death.  ___  Loller and Mattise reported from Nashville.

0,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/nyc-council-overrides-mayors-vetoes-of-solitary-confinement-ban-policing-bill,"By Jonathan Allen  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York City Council voted on Tuesday to override Mayor Eric Adams' vetoes of two bills it passed last month, one banning solitary confinement in city jails, the other requiring police to record lower-level investigative stops of civilians.  In passing the bills with veto-proof majorities in December, lawmakers called solitary confinement cruel and torturous, and said it leads to heightened risks of injury or death for people in custody, particularly in the city's violence-plagued main jail complex on Rikers Island.  Under the How Many Stops Act, police officers will have to record basic demographic information about people they question in low-level investigative stops, why they made the stop, and whether an officer used force against a person they questioned.  The New York Police Department, which is the subject of an independent monitor appointed by a federal judge over its past practice of stopping and frisking Black and Latino New Yorkers in disproportionate numbers, has joined the mayor, a former NYPD captain, in opposing the law.  Lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled council said the law amounted to a simple extension of existing reporting requirements that ""the most technologically advanced police department in the world can easily implement.""  ""At a time when Black and Latino New Yorkers continue to be disproportionately subjected to unconstitutional stops that go underreported, and civilian complaints of misconduct are at their highest level in over a decade, the need for basic transparency is clear,"" Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said in a statement.  At least two thirds of the council's 51 members must vote in favor in order to override a mayor's veto of a bill.  In vetoing boths bills this month, Mayor Adams, a Democrat and no relation to the council speaker, said the new reporting requirements would distract police officers from their jobs.  In an interview with NY1 shortly before the council's vote, the mayor said that, before the law goes into effect, ""let's correct the parts of it that is going to be burdensome to catching people who are dangerous in our city.""  The mayor and the labor union representing the city's jail guards argued the solitary confinement ban will make it more difficult to protect jail workers and detainees, most of whom are awaiting trial and were denied or unable to afford release on bail.  Under current ""punitive segregation"" rules, jail officials can punish detainees who are violent or otherwise break jail rules by isolating them in a cell for up to 23 hours a day for up to 60 days straight for the most serious infractions.  The new law reduces that to a maximum of four hours, with wellness checks by jail staff every 15 minutes. For serious infractions, detainees can be transferred to restrictive housing for up to 60 days in a single year.

""I gave him $1 million towards his legal fees a few weeks ago. I made a promise to give him $20 million more, that will be to the super PAC,"" the Nevada-based owner of Budget Suites of America said in an interview.  The commitments, which have not been previously reported, show some big money is coalescing around Trump, the runaway frontrunner to clinch the Republican presidential nomination to face Democrat Joe Biden in the November general election.  Bigelow's donations also highlight the unusual role some political donors are playing as Trump faces four pending criminal cases this year.  Those cases include two over his efforts to reverse his 2020 presidential election loss, one over his handling of classified documents upon leaving office and another over his hush money payments to a porn star.  Bigelow, who also founded Bigelow Aerospace and funds investigations into extraterrestrial life, said he felt Trump was being unfairly targeted in the criminal cases and that his sympathy towards the former president had motivated the donation.  ""I was just sympathetic. They didn't solicit anything from me,"" Bigelow said. The $20 million would be spread out but ""starts right away,"" he added.  The Justice Department says it acts without political bias.  All of Trump's Republican rivals, bar former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, have dropped out of the race, and Trump is all but assured of clinching the nomination.  Trump and his team have been seeking to peel wealthy benefactors away from Haley, making calls trying to convince donors to switch sides. Trump has gone so far as to warn the donors they would be banished from his orbit if they made further donations.  Bigelow initially backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the Republican nomination, but dropped him in part over his strict anti-abortion policies.  BILLS AND FINES  For all of Trump's political success, however, his legal costs are rapidly mounting.  Trump was hit last week with an $83 million verdict in a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, and a judge is set to rule any day now on the New York Attorney General’s request for $370 million in penalties for his misrepresentations to banks about his net worth.  The New York Times reported earlier on Tuesday that pro-Trump groups spent some $50 million on legal bills and ""investigation-related"" expenses in 2023. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that figure.  Bigelow said he could not remember the exact name of the entity to which he sent the $1 million, but Trump's Save America PAC has been an important vehicle for paying his legal fees. When asked whether he was considering donating more to help pay Trump's legal fees, Bigelow declined to comment.  Bigelow said he had dinner with Trump on Monday night at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.  ""It was supposed to be one hour. It was over two hours. And we still ran out of time,"" Bigelow said, declining to provide details of their conversation.  Bigelow said he was concerned about turmoil in the Middle East and felt confident in Trump's capacity to navigate crises given his 2017-2021 term in the White House.

But that's not exactly what's going on, a new study suggests.  Rather than being attracted to light, researchers believe that artificial lights at night may actually scramble flying insects' innate navigational systems, causing them to flutter in confusion around porch lamps, street lights and other artificial beacons.  “Insects have a navigational problem,” said Tyson Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the research. “They're accustomed to using light as a cue to know which way is up.”  Insects do not fly directly toward a light source, but actually “tilt their backs toward the light,” said Sam Fabian, an Imperial College London entomologist and co-author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  That would make sense if the strongest light source was in the sky. But in the presence of artificial lights, the result is midair confusion, not attraction.  For the study, researchers attached tiny sensors to moths and dragonflies in a laboratory to film “motion-capture” video of flight — similar to how filmmakers attach sensors to actors to track their movements.  They also used high-resolution cameras to film insects swirling around lights at a field site in Costa Rica.  This allowed them to study in detail how dragonflies will circle endlessly around light sources, positioning themselves with their backs facing the beams. They also documented that some insects will flip upside down — and often crash land — in the presence of lights that shine straight upward like search lights.  Insect flight was least disrupted by bright lights that shine straight downward, the researchers found.  “For millions of years, insects oriented themselves by sensing that the sky is light, the ground is dark"" — until people invented artificial lights, said Avalon Owens, a Harvard entomologist who was not involved in the research.  ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Johnson informed teams he would not be leaving the Lions. They spoke on condition of anonymity because Johnson's plans had not been announced.  Johnson was considered one of the front-runners for the Commanders in their widespread coaching search and he also interviewed twice with the Seahawks, most recently in person Monday. He was scheduled to talk to the Commanders on Tuesday.  One of the people familiar with the situation said the Washington brass is still meeting with Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn.  Johnson, 37, and Glenn helped coach Dan Campbell and the Lions win twice in the same playoffs for the first time since winning the NFL title in 1957 and reach the NFC championship game for the second time in team history and first time in 32 years. Their 34-31 loss to San Francisco on Sunday paved the way for teams to hire Johnson or Glenn.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  This was Johnson's second season running Detroit's offense after serving in various coaching roles the three previous seasons.  Johnson, whom Campbell has called “a rock star,” broke into the NFL with Miami in 2012 after spending three years as an assistant at Boston College. He worked his way up with the Dolphins to receivers coach in 2018 before getting hired by Detroit and playing a major role in Jared Goff’s growth as a QB.  Last year, Johnson interviewed for the Houston Texans vacancy before they hired DeMeco Ryans.  Johnson staying in Detroit means the Commanders are left with a handful of candidates they’ve interviewed: Glenn, Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, Houston offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik and Baltimore assistants Mike Macdonald and Anthony Weaver. It’s unclear if they’ll pivot to former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, their own offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy or someone else after missing out on the opportunity to hire Johnson.  Seattle was also interested in Johnson after Pete Carroll was let go following 14 seasons in charge. Johnson had a first interview with Seattle virtually and a follow up in-person interview on Monday after the Lions' loss in the NFC title game.  Seattle made it clear that Johnson was one of its top candidates when it didn’t move forward on a hire prior to the conference championship games. Quinn seemed a clear front-runner because of his past connections to Seattle.  But the longer the Seahawks went without moving ahead with Quinn, the more it became obvious there were other options being considered, including Macdonald.  ___  Whyno reported from Washington.  ___  AP Sports Writer Tim Booth contributed.  ___",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Lions OC Ben Johnson Is Staying, Turning Down Possible Chance to Be NFL Head Coach, AP Sources Say",4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Cori Bush of Missouri misused campaign funds for her own personal security, the progressive lawmaker confirmed in a statement Tuesday.  Bush, a second-term lawmaker, denied any wrongdoing and said she is “fully cooperating” with federal prosecutors.  “As a rank-and-file member of Congress I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services,” Bush said. “I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services.”  Her statement came a day after the Justice Department subpoenaed the office of the House Sergeant of Arms for related documents. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Since being elected to the House in 2021, Bush, a Black woman with activist roots, has been the target of right-wing attacks. As a result, she has spent a substantial amount of money on private security while she's on Capitol Hill and back home in her district in St. Louis.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Federal prosecutors have been asking questions about Bush’s security expenses, the threats she received and her decision to pay her now-husband Cortney Merritts with campaign funds to provide security, a person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. The questions have been similar to those asked by congressional investigators conducting an ethics inquiry, the person said. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  The issue of how Bush has been funding her security is currently under investigation by the Federal Election Commission and the House Committee on Ethics. The FEC has stated that it is not technically against the rules for a member of Congress to use campaign funds for private security as there has been a striking increase of violent threats against lawmakers in recent years.

The Wichita fire department received a call around 8:40 a.m. about a trash can on fire at Garvey Park in the southern part of the city and discovered what appeared to be pieces of the statue, according to police spokesperson Andrew Ford. At a news conference Tuesday, he described it as “not salvageable.""  The statue, which was cut at the figure's ankles, went missing Thursday morning. It honors the first player to break Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1947.  “If it turns out it was racially motivated, then obviously that is a deeper societal issue and it certainly would make this a much more concerning theft,” said Bob Lutz, Executive Director of the Little League nonprofit that commissioned the sculpture. “We’ll wait and see what this turns out to be.”  League 42, which is named after Robinson’s Dodgers number, paid about $50,000 for the model, which was installed in 2021 in McAdams Park, where roughly 600 children play in the youth baseball league. It also offers educational programs.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The police spokesperson said that with assistance from arson investigators, they have conducted more than 100 interviews. Surveillance video shows two people hauling the sculpture away in the dark, to a truck that was later found abandoned.  “Yes, it's really disheartening to see the remnants of the statue and the disgraceful way in which it has been disrespected,” Wichita police Chief Joe Sullivan said, describing the discovery of it as a “direct indication of the pressure” suspects felt from the ongoing investigation.  He said police are conferring with the prosecutor's office on a regular basis.  “There will be arrests, but we're going to make sure that when we do, we will have a solid case,” he said, adding that for anyone involved in the theft “it is only a matter of time.”  Robinson played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues before joining the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for generations of Black American ballplayers. He’s considered not only a sports legend but also a civil rights icon.  Lutz, the nonprofit director, said there will be a new statue installed that will look exactly like the old one, which was made by his friend, the artist John Parsons, before his death. He said the mold is still viable and anticipated that a replacement could be erected within a matter of months.  “I'm trying to keep it together,"" he said, adding: “The statue that reappears at McAdams Park will be the work of John Parsons.” He stressed that “we are ready for some joy.”  The theft was discovered shortly before Black History Month. But Lutz said in an interview after the news conference that he was hopeful the motive wasn't racial, but that the thieves just saw the bronze as monetarily valuable.  Council Member Brandon Johnson described the statue as a “symbol of hope” and said donations for the replacement are coming from local businesses and through an online fundraiser.  “This now lets us know that we need a new statue,” he said of the destroyed remains. “We’re no longer looking for a complete intact statue.

It honors the first player to break Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1947.  “If it turns out it was racially motivated, then obviously that is a deeper societal issue and it certainly would make this a much more concerning theft,” said Bob Lutz, Executive Director of the Little League nonprofit that commissioned the sculpture. “We’ll wait and see what this turns out to be.”  League 42, which is named after Robinson’s Dodgers number, paid about $50,000 for the model, which was installed in 2021 in McAdams Park, where roughly 600 children play in the youth baseball league. It also offers educational programs.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The police spokesperson said that with assistance from arson investigators, they have conducted more than 100 interviews. Surveillance video shows two people hauling the sculpture away in the dark, to a truck that was later found abandoned.  “Yes, it's really disheartening to see the remnants of the statue and the disgraceful way in which it has been disrespected,” Wichita police Chief Joe Sullivan said, describing the discovery of it as a “direct indication of the pressure” suspects felt from the ongoing investigation.  He said police are conferring with the prosecutor's office on a regular basis.  “There will be arrests, but we're going to make sure that when we do, we will have a solid case,” he said, adding that for anyone involved in the theft “it is only a matter of time.”  Robinson played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues before joining the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for generations of Black American ballplayers. He’s considered not only a sports legend but also a civil rights icon.  Lutz, the nonprofit director, said there will be a new statue installed that will look exactly like the old one, which was made by his friend, the artist John Parsons, before his death. He said the mold is still viable and anticipated that a replacement could be erected within a matter of months.  “I'm trying to keep it together,"" he said, adding: “The statue that reappears at McAdams Park will be the work of John Parsons.” He stressed that “we are ready for some joy.”  The theft was discovered shortly before Black History Month. But Lutz said in an interview after the news conference that he was hopeful the motive wasn't racial, but that the thieves just saw the bronze as monetarily valuable.  Council Member Brandon Johnson described the statue as a “symbol of hope” and said donations for the replacement are coming from local businesses and through an online fundraiser.  “This now lets us know that we need a new statue,” he said of the destroyed remains. “We’re no longer looking for a complete intact statue. We know we need to raise the money to replace it, and we will do so.”  ___  This story has been corrected to show that the nonprofit is named League 42, not League 32.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Burned Remnants of Prized Jackie Robinson Statue Found After Theft From Public Park in Kansas,3 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

(AP) — The Georgia Ports Authority said Tuesday that it moved a record number of automobiles across its docks in Brunswick last year, while goods shipped to Savannah in cargo containers declined 16%.  The Port of Brunswick rolled more than 775,000 autos and heavy machinery units on and off ships in the 2023 calendar year, when U.S. auto sales saw their biggest increase in more than a decade. That is the port's highest ever auto and machinery total and an increase of more than 15% over the previous year.  The news comes as port authority CEO Griff Lynch has set a goal of Brunswick surpassing the Port of Baltimore as the No. 1 U.S. port for automobile imports and exports. The Georgia agency is investing $262 million in upgrades and expansions to make room for growth at the Brunswick port, located about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah.  “We have been investing in Brunswick. We've been creating capacity in Brunswick,” Lynch said in an interview, adding that more growth is possible in 2024. “Autos are strong. I mean, the economy will drive the autos, so we’ll have to see how that plays out. But right now, they’re strong.”  Auto shipments into Georgia boomed last year as sales surged amid pent-up demand following a computer chip shortage that slowed assembly lines.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Georgia's push to become a Southern hub for electric vehicle production is expected to send more autos across Brunswick's docks in the coming years. Hyundai is building its first U.S. plant dedicated to EVs west of Savannah, while electric truck maker Rivian is constructing a factory east of Atlanta. Kia last summer announced an expansion of its plant in West Point to manufacture electric SUVs.  Meanwhile, the Port of Savannah saw a notable dip in cargo shipped in containers, the giant metal boxes used to pack retail goods from consumer electronics to frozen chickens. Savannah is the fourth-busiest U.S. seaport for containerized cargo, behind only New York, Los Angeles and Long Beach, California.  Savannah handled 4.9 million container units of imports and exports last year, down 16% compared with calendar 2022. Lynch said retailers ordered less inventory as inflation and higher interest rates cooled consumer spending.  That could be changing. Savannah's container numbers for January are on track to outpace the same month last year, and Lynch said he anticipates that trend will continue in the coming months.  “I fully believe that when we look at February and March and April, we should see some positive numbers year-over-year,” Lynch said. “The numbers are stronger than we anticipated.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Georgia Seaports Handled a Record Number of Automobiles in 2023 While Container Trade Dropped 16%,6 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
3,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/citibank-sued-by-new-york-over-alleged-failure-to-reimburse-fraud-victims,"By Luc Cohen and Tatiana Bautzer  NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state's attorney general's office said on Tuesday said it had sued Citibank for allegedly failing to protect customers from electronic fraud and reimburse victims, which it said had cost customers in the state millions of dollars.  In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, Attorney General Letitia James alleged Citi's lax security protocols allowed scammers to gain easy access to users' accounts and steal their deposits through unauthorized wire transfers.  ""Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi's negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people,"" James said in a statement.  In a statement, a Citi spokesperson said Citi had taken steps to boost security, resulting in a significant drop in wire fraud. But the spokesman said the bank had followed all laws and regulations related to wire transfers.  ""Banks are not required to make clients whole when those clients follow criminals' instructions and banks can see no indication the clients are being deceived,"" the spokesman said.  James' lawsuit asked Citibank to disgorge profits, pay a $5,000 fine for each instance in which it violated the law, and appoint a third-party monitor to identify all customers who were harmed.  James said customers who reported fraud were subject to lengthy telephone holds, and were told by Citi staff that they would get reimbursed even though the bank took no immediate steps to recover funds.  The lawsuit mentions two clients. One had $40,000 stolen from her retirement savings account in 2021 after clicking the link in a text message that appeared to be from Citi.  The customer reported suspicious activity and was told not to worry. But three days she later discovered a scammer had changed her banking password and enrolled in online wire transfers. The bank denied her fraud claim.  Another New Yorker had $35,000 stolen after reviewing her online account and finding a message that it had been suspended and telling her to call a phone number.  A scammer told her he would send her Citi codes to verify recent suspicious activity. He then transferred all of the money in the customer's three savings accounts into her checking account, changed her online passwords, and stole the $35,000.

4,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/family/best-strollers,"Things To Consider When Buying Strollers  Adjustability and Comfort Features: The more adjustable features, the more comfortable both baby and parent will be. However, customizable options can come at a cost. Having the ability to recline the seat is a big one, as it’ll make your little one comfortable for naps on the go or just relaxing during extra-long days. Some of the best strollers have an adjustable calf support or leg rest, too. For parents, look for a model that has an adjustable handlebar. It’ll especially come in handy if you and your partner have a big height difference, as both of you will be able to use it without hunching over or reaching up.  Then there are the extras that may or may not come included with the stroller, but, at the very least, they’re probably available to buy separately. Don’t underestimate the convenience of a snack tray for your child as well as some sort of handlebar cup holder and organizer situation for you. After all, you need somewhere to put your phone and keys even if you’re just walking around the block.  Safety Certifications and Features: Strollers have a three- or five-point harness. For extra support, many models have a belly bar that sits in front of the child, but some sell them separately. The brakes, which are typically accessed via a lever by a wheel but can also be on the handlebar, are important to use no matter what type of ground you’re standing on. If you and the stroller are stationary, be safe and hold it in place.  “Seek strollers with certifications like JPMA (Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association),” advises Alli Cavasino, co-founder and CEO of JoyLet. “The JPMA is an industry group and voice of the industry on quality and safety for baby and children’s products. Some manufacturers also pursue OEKO-TEX Standard testing. This certification is one of the world's best-known labels for textiles that are tested for harmful substances.” Other safety certifications include ASTM and CPSC.  “There are many different stroller brands, sizes, and price points to choose from that can be overwhelming. Rest at ease knowing that all strollers sold in the USA have had to pass the same Federal Law requirements, which means picking the right stroller is often more about personal preference,” says Emily Hosie, CEO and founder of Rebelstork.  Stroller Weight and Foldability: Compact and travel-friendly strollers are designed to be lighter in weight so you can bring them wherever your adventures take you. Many also fold down small enough to be approved as a carry-on item on an airplane and even fit in the overhead bin. If you’re planning to use a stroller for that reason, it’s even more important to check its weight and folded dimensions (and double-check with the airline that it meets their requirements).  Not every stroller is the easiest to close, and the simplest ones will feature a one-hand fold so you can have your baby in one hand and fold up the stroller with another. While that’s certainly convenient, it might not be a possibility with some full-size models.  Canopy Size and UV Protection: As much as both parents and babies love fresh air, you have to think about their precious skin and eyes. Some strollers have much smaller canopies, while others have large ones with several levels so you can pull them out a little or nearly cover your entire baby to shield them from the sun. If this is a secondary stroller or one you use primarily for quick in-and-out errands, a large sunshade might not be necessary, but if it’s your only stroller or one you plan to take on vacation, a proper canopy is needed.  “Establishing a barrier between your baby’s skin and UV rays is considered one of the most effective ways to protect … against sun damage,” explains Hosie. “Look for a canopy that has a 50+ rating, allowing it to block high levels of UV rays.”  Terrain Adaptability and Wheel Type: Where you plan to take your stroller is the deciding factor on what kind of wheels and suspension system to look for. Simply walking around town is much different from jogging a hiking trail.  “Different wheel types suit different environments. For those exploring grassy parks, cobblestone streets, or venturing onto nature trails, larger wheels with robust suspension are needed. These elements offer stability and smoother navigation across uneven surfaces, ensuring a more enjoyable ride for the child and easier maneuverability for the parent,” explains Cavasino. “Conversely, strollers designed for urban environments might prioritize smaller, more agile wheels suited for seamless navigation through crowded streets or tight spaces, like shops and cafes. These strollers may not require the same level of off-road adaptability but excel in urban settings where maneuverability and compactness are required.”  Look for all-terrain, puncture-proof wheels if you foresee hitting the great outdoors on the regular. Larger wheels help make the ride smoother on bumpy surfaces.  Storage Options and Carrying Capacity: A stroller could meet all of your qualifications for when it’s in use, but don’t forget it has to get from point A to point B. Do you need a superlightweight model because you’re constantly packing it up for travel? Or is a full-size, heavier stroller OK because you don’t have to move it far? To make carrying the stroller easier, some models come with built-in handles or an included carrying case. Either one would certainly come in handy if you tend to travel quite a bit. A case is also useful depending on how you plan to store it in between uses. It won’t be a priority if you keep your stroller fully assembled and ready to use, but if you need to tuck it away, making sure you choose a unit that’s compact and stores as flat as possible is a must.  “Will the stroller be primarily stored in the back of your trunk, or in a shared entryway? A compact travel stroller might be for you. Lifestyle considerations will help a parent decide which stroller style will be most convenient,” shares Cavasino.  Compatibility With Infant Car Seats: Taking a child in and out of any seat is half the battle when heading out for the day, especially if there are multiple kids. A stroller and car seat combo cuts down on frustrations by keeping your little one in their seat.  “With a brand new baby, having a car seat that is stroller compatible creates convenience,” says Hosie. “You can simply transfer your baby from the car to the stroller and back without having to wake or move the baby. This saves time and gives parents more freedom to run errands and travel with their baby more efficiently.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Best Strollers of 2024,6 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
5,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/cost-job-worries-have-many-americans-postponing-surgeries,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Older adults frequently delay needed surgery because of financial concerns, a new study finds.  Nearly half of people ages 50 and older who were very concerned about the cost of surgery wound up not having an operation they had considered, researchers reported Jan. 30 in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Further, more than half who were very concerned about taking time off work wound up dropping plans for surgery, results show.  “When I counsel patients in my clinic who are considering elective surgery, I now also spend a good deal of time discussing the financial and employment implications of surgery with them,” said researcher Dr. Nicholas Berlin, a surgical fellow with the University of Michigan Medical School.  “Unfortunately, I have seen a number of insured patients forego needed surgery because they are unable to afford the out-of-pocket costs or take time away from work for recovery,” Berlin added in a university news release.  For the study, Berlin and his colleagues analyzed data from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, which showed in 2022 that nearly half of older adults considering surgery had concerns about costs, work time lost or COVID risk.  About two-thirds who said they were very concerned about COVID exposure during surgery or recovery wound up not having an operation they had considered, researchers found.  On the other hand, few patients dropped plans for surgery due to concerns over pain or recovery.  For instance, those very concerned about surgery-related pain were as likely as those with no concerns about pain to proceed with their planned operation, results show.  Berlin said that federal policymakers have tried to address cost issues by requiring price transparency from hospitals. Those efforts also include reducing the amount of tacked-on “surprise” billing that can occur when someone receives care from a provider not in their insurance network.  However, those policies don’t address lost wages from taking work off for surgery or costs related to the way a person’s health insurance is structured, Berlin said.  For example, over the past two decades the percentage of people over 60 who work has doubled. At the same time, enrollment in limited-network Medicare Advantage plans and high-deductible heath plans has grown.  More research is needed to understand what influences a person’s decision to proceed with operations, said poll director Dr. Jeffrey Kullgren, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan.  “More research is needed to understand and address caregiver impacts, which were also a factor in not having surgery for some people in the study,” Kullgren added. “This includes both those who are concerned about surgery temporarily making them unable to care for someone else, and those concerned about having someone to care for them after their operation.”  The poll included 2,110 adults between the ages of 50 and 80, of whom 32% had considered an elective surgical procedure in the previous five years. Two-thirds of those who considered an operation wound up going through with it.  The most common elective operations were knee or hip replacement, cataract surgery, hernia repair, gall bladder removal and hysterectomy, results show.  Those procedures can be medically necessary and covered by insurance, but some participants also had considered cosmetic surgery, which is paid for entirely out of pocket.

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/french-farmers-block-roads-with-tractors-press-government-for-action,"By Yves Herman and Kate Abnett  JOSSIGNY, France/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -French and Belgian farmers angry about rising costs, EU environmental policies and cheap food imports blocked highways and access roads to a major container port on Tuesday as the protests spread across Europe.  In France, farmers, who have been protesting for over two weeks, stepped up their pressure on the government by blocking highways with their tractors near Paris and setting bales of hay ablaze to partly block access to Toulouse airport.  ""Whatever happens, we are determined to go to the end,"" farmer Jean-Baptiste Bongard said as crowds of farmers huddled together around small fires on a highway in Jossigny, near Paris, blocked by the tractors.  ""If the movement needs to last a month, then it will last a month,"" said Bongard.  In Belgium, where protests have been inspired by those in neighbouring France, farmers blocked access roads to the Zeebrugge container port.  Farmers organising the protest said they planned to bar access to the North Sea port, the country's second-largest, for at least 36 hours. They targeted it because they said it received economic support at the expense of farmers.  Belgian farmers also blocked a square in central Brussels, saying they would stay put until at least Thursday, when EU leaders meet in the city for a summit.  Spanish farmers said they would join the movement and organise protests in February.  The French protests follow similar action in other European countries, including Germany and Poland, ahead of European Parliament elections in June in which the far right, for whom farmers represent a growing constituency, is seen making gains.  CHEAP IMPORTS COMPLAINT  Farmers say they are not being paid enough, are choked by excessive regulation on environmental protection and face unfair competition from cheap imports.  ""The farmers are desperate, really desperate,"" said Mark Wulfrancke, from Belgium's Algemeen Boerensyndicaat.  ""We want respect from our government, the European government. The only way to show that respect is to make a policy that is farmer friendly, food friendly. We need a correct price,"" Wulfrancke told Reuters.  In France, the protests increased in intensity on Monday, leading up to the EU summit, when they hope their action and those of other farmers in Europe will grab the attention of the politicians focused on aid for Ukraine and the bloc's budget.  While the farmers' crisis is not officially on the agenda, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would discuss it with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and government leaders.  Much of the bloc's agricultural rules, hefty subsidies and import rules are decided in Brussels jointly by member states and the European Parliament, alongside the executive European Commission.  ""We need to have a European debate,"" Macron said on Tuesday.  Wary of protests escalating, the French government has already dropped plans to gradually reduce subsidies on agricultural diesel and promised to ease environmental regulations.  ""We've asked (the EU) for very concrete things for our farmers,"" said Macron, calling in particular to ensure that imported produce meets European standards.  MERCOSUR TRADE TALKS  Imports from Ukraine, on which the EU has waived quotas and duties since Russia's February 2022 invasion, and renewed negotiations to conclude the Mercosur trade deal with South American countries have fanned farmers' discontent about unfair competition in sugar, grain and meat.  France wants ""to have clear measures on imports from Ukraine because today we have in volume and quality things that are destabilising the European market, whether chicken or cereals"", Macron said.  The European Commission said on Tuesday that it was continuing to pursue trade talks with the Mercosur bloc, a day after Macron's office said it understood the EU had halted talks.  Brazil's Foreign Trade Secretary Tatiana Prazeres also said on Tuesday that negotiations were ongoing.  But Macron insisted he did not want the agreement as it was currently drafted, due to a lack of guarantees that imported products would have to follow similar rules as European ones.  Several other EU members back the deal, which would be the largest trade agreement for the bloc in terms of tariff reduction and part of the EU strategy of trade diversification following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a desire to reduce its reliance on China.  ""Contrary to common French practice, the EU does not in fact operate by presidential decree,"" one EU diplomat said.  EU governments and the European Parliament need to approve any trade deal the Commission has reached.  Macron also said he wanted more flexibility on some of the EU's joint agricultural rules, including on fallow land.  There, the European Commission appeared poised to offer some policy changes, by proposing to extend an exemption on rules requiring farmers to leave part of their land fallow if they apply for EU subsidies.  Farmers must normally meet certain conditions including devoting 4% of farmland to ""non-productive"" areas where nature can recover, though there is already a temporary exemption in response to the Ukraine war and food security concerns.  The 4% rule on fallow land was part of the grievances that led to protests in France and elsewhere.  Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau will be in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss France's farming demands, his office said.

7,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/massachusetts-state-troopers-arrested-for-taking-bribes-to-pass-commercial-drivers-on-test,"BOSTON (AP) — Two current and two former Massachusetts State Police troopers were among six people charged Tuesday in a scheme to allegedly take bribes including a new snowblower and driveway in exchange for giving passing scores on commercial driving tests, the U.S. attorney’s office said.  The troopers are accused of falsifying records and giving preferential treatment to at least 17 drivers from May 2019 to January 2023, who were taking their commercial drivers license or CDL test. Even when the drivers failed a skills test, the troopers passed them and communicated they had done so with a text and the code word golden. Some troopers even joked in the text messages how badly a driver had performed on the test, according to the indictment.  “In short, as is alleged in this indictment, CDLs were for sale,” Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy told reporters. “Troopers were bribed with free goods to pass applicants no matter how they performed on the test.”  Sgt. Gary Cederquist, 58, of Stoughton, and Trooper Joel Rogers, 54, of Bridgewater, were arrested Tuesday. Calvin Butner, 63, of Halifax, and Perry Mendes, 63, of Wareham, both retired state troopers, were arrested in Florida Monday. All four face more than 70 counts on a range of charges including conspiracy to falsify records, extortion and making false statements.  Two others, Eric Mathison, 47, of Boston and Scott Camara, 42, of Rehoboth, were also implicated in the scheme.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Cederquist, Rogers, Mathison and Camera made their initial appearance Tuesday afternoon and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Butner and Mendes were expected to make appearances at a later date. A phone number could not be found for any of the six and their lawyers did not respond for a request for comment.  Cederquist, who also is accused of helping four state troopers get commercial drivers licenses, is accused of accepting a new driveway worth $10,000 and a snowblower valued at $2,000 and a $750 granite mailbox. Cederquist also asked for a shed and a plunge pool in exchange for passing drivers.  “Let me be clear. Those named in this indictment that have lost their moral compass and they will be held accountable” Michael Krol, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations New England, said. “Their actions, however, should not tarnish the reputation of an entire institution especially for the overwhelming majority of public servants in the Massachusetts State Police and fire service who serve the citizens of our commonwealth day in and day out with pride, honor and integrity.”  Brian Williams, the president of the State Police Association, said they were “disappointed” to learn about the indictments.  ""As the newly elected President of the Association, I take these allegations seriously and urge everyone to wait until a thorough examination of the facts is public in order to ensure that the case is adjudicated in a fair and impartial manner,"" Williams said in a statement.  The allegations are the latest scandal to hit the the state police.  Forty-six current and retired troopers who worked for the now disbanded Troop E, which patrolled the Massachusetts Turnpike, were implicated in a scheme in which they collected overtime pay for shifts they either did not work or did not complete from 2015 until 2017, authorities said. Often, they said, the troopers issued falsified traffic tickets to make it appear as if they had been on duty.  The allegations also raise concerns about the integrity of a licensing system set up to certify commercial drivers, since a majority of those taken the test in Massachusetts fail. The latest data from 2022, federal officials said, showed a pass rate of 41%.  In 2019, the system came under fire after Volodymyr Zhukovsky, a commercial truck driver, crashed into a group of motorcyclists in northern New Hampshire, causing the death of of causing the deaths of seven motorcyclists.  Zhukovskyy’s commercial driving license should have been revoked in Massachusetts at the time of the crash because of a drunken driving arrest in Connecticut about two months earlier. Connecticut officials alerted the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, but Zhukovskyy’s license wasn’t suspended due to a backlog of out-of-state notifications about driving offenses.  “There are a lot of problems on the roads these — road rage and other things like that. This unfortunately will add to people's level of concern,” Levy said. “It's concerning to me just as someone driving on the roads that this happened... You hope that something like this cleans up a system where there has been such serious allegations of misconduct.”  Since last year, state police said they have made a number of reforms to the commercial drivers license unit including requiring body cameras be worn during exams, increasing frequency of unannounced visits unit by supervisors to examiners at training sites as well as developing new training procedures and a curriculum.  “The Department condemns the actions of the four current and former CDL Unit members as alleged in the federal indictment and our internal affairs investigation,"" Colonel John Mawn Jr., the interim superintendent, said in a statement. ""The alleged misconduct of those defendants is the antithesis of and in stark contrast to the values, character, and integrity exhibited by the overwhelming majority of our Troopers every day in service to the public.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Massachusetts State Troopers Arrested for Taking Bribes to Pass Commercial Drivers on Test,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

(AP) — Joe Hortiz is going from assembling talent for John Harbaugh to leading the football operations with Jim Harbaugh.  Hortiz has agreed to terms to become the Los Angeles Chargers general manager. The team made the announcement Tuesday morning.  Hortiz — who was one of nine candidates to interview for the job — will replace Tom Telesco, who was fired on Dec. 15 after nearly 11 seasons as GM.  “Joe is one of the most respected player evaluators and personnel minds in the league whose contributions to the Ravens front office over the past two decades cannot be overstated,” Chargers president of football operations John Spanos said in a statement.  “When you consider his football IQ, eye for talent, ability to think both short and long term as it pertains to roster construction, organization, thoroughness and ability to be creative within the confines of our collective bargaining agreement, it’s hard not to be excited about the future.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  ""Factor in his experience working with two of the best in the business in Ozzie Newsome and Eric DeCosta and the consistency of performance that their teams have achieved, Joe is without a doubt the right person to help Coach Harbaugh and his staff build a team that will make Chargers fans proud.”  Hortiz has spent his entire NFL career with the Baltimore Ravens. He started as an area scout in 1998 and has been the Ravens director of player personnel for five seasons. Hortiz has overseen all aspects of pro and college scouting since 2019.  Prior to becoming director of player personnel, Hortiz was the Ravens director of college scouting from 2009-18.  Jim Harbaugh was hired as Chargers head coach last Wednesday and will hold his first news conference on Thursday. Harbaugh was in Baltimore on Sunday for the AFC championship game when the Ravens lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.  Hortiz's first interview with the Chargers was on Jan. 13. He had a second interview last Friday.  “When you’ve had the privilege of working with one organization your entire career, something that’s exceedingly rare in our business, the opportunity and fit has to pretty much be perfect to consider a change,” Hortiz said in a statement.  “This is that opportunity. Then of course, having known the Harbaugh family for all these years and the chance to continue that special relationship in this new role, I truly could not be more fortunate.”  Hortiz's introductory news conference will be on Feb. 6.  New York Giants assistant GM Brandon Brown was the only other candidate to get a second interview.  Hortiz won't need to find a franchise quarterback since the Chargers already have one in Justin Herbert. But he will have to make a lot of key roster decisions with the Bolts at least $45 million over the salary cap. Wide receivers Mike Williams and Keenan Allen, along with linebackers Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa, have cap numbers of at least $30 million for the 2024 season.  Los Angeles also has the fifth overall pick in April's draft after a disappointing 5-12 season, including five straight losses to end the campaign.  ___",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Joe Hortiz Agrees to Terms to Become Los Angeles Chargers General Manager,6 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Hatton had been mentioned as a LIV Golf target ever since the Saudi-funded league signed Rahm in a surprising move toward the end of last year. Rahm and Hatton have been partners in the last two Ryder Cup matches.  The Daily Telegraph reported Hatton signed a bonus of 50 million pounds ($63 million).  LIV Golf starts its third year this week at Mayakoba on the Gulf coast of Mexico. Hatton will be part of Rahm's new team called Legion XIII.  Also joining Rahm's team are Kieran Vincent of Zimbabwe and Caleb Surratt, who played college golf at Tennessee and competed in the Walker Cup last year at St. Andrews. Vincent, the brother of LIV Golf player Scott Vincent, earned a spot in the league at the qualifying tournament last year.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “We’ve come a long way in a short period of time and are extremely proud of the team and brand we are building,” Rahm said. “As we were developing the team’s brand it became clear that I wanted to fight alongside a group of guys who aligned perfectly with what the team stands for.”  He described Hatton as a “fierce competitor, proven champion"" and his Ryder Cup teammate.  Hatton, who has gone two years since his last win at the Abu Dhabi Championship, is No. 16 in the world. He has seven victories worldwide, including the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in 2020.  Hatton and Rahm were 3-0 in team matches at the Ryder Cup in 2023 and 2021. Hatton went 3-0-1 for Europe when it regained the cup at Marco Simone last September.  “I’m really excited for this next chapter, to link up with Jon Rahm and Legion XIII, and to get started this week in Mexico,” Hatton said.  He was listed in the field for the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am this week, and recently was confirmed to play in the Phoenix Open.  LIV Golf now has 13 teams, after two years of 12 four-man teams.

1,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin/articles/2024-01-30/wisconsin-elections-officials-expected-to-move-quickly-on-absentee-ballot-rules,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday ordered the state elections commission to implement his ruling allowing election clerks to accept absentee ballots that have partial witness addresses, a decision that is expected to expand the number of ballots that will be counted in the battleground state.  Each of the last two presidential elections in Wisconsin was decided by fewer than 23,000 votes. Polls show another razor-tight race this year between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.  Ever since Trump's defeat in Wisconsin in 2020, Republicans have been fighting in court to tighten the rules to limit how many absentee ballots can be accepted.  State law requires absentee ballots to be submitted with a witness’ signature and address on the outside envelope that contains the ballot. Three separate lawsuits were filed related to those rules.  Dane County Judge Ryan Nilsestuen earlier this month ruled, in two cases brought by liberals, that a ballot can still be accepted even if a witness address omits municipalities and ZIP codes, or simply say “same” or “ditto” if the witness lives with the voter. The Republican Legislature fought to have the case dismissed.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Nilsestuen on Tuesday ordered the elections commission to approve guidance no later than Feb. 9 that would direct clerks on what ballots can be accepted. Nilsestuen stressed that he wanted to move quickly given the upcoming Feb. 20 primary for local elections. Wisconsin's presidential primary and spring general election is April 2.  The Republican-dominated Legislature's attorney, Kevin LeRoy, said he planned to ask for the ruling to be put on hold pending an appeal. The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on that.  The case is expected to go to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  But first, the state elections commission will likely vote Feb. 8 on approving guidance for Wisconsin's more than 1,800 local clerks in line with the judge's order. The local clerks are the ones who run elections and receive the absentee ballots that don’t always have all of the witness address information.  “We’ll try to turn it around as fast possible,"" Bellavia said. ""WEC wants this system to work.”  The elections commission published guidance in 2016 saying that a witness address “contain at a minimum, a street number, street name and municipality,"" but that clerks could fill in missing address information, known as ballot curing. The practice was unchallenged until after Trump’s narrow loss in 2020 when he tried to have more than 220,000 absentee ballots tossed out in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn his defeat.  Among those he wanted to not count were about 5,500 absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on the witness' address.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in December 2020 rejecting Trump's lawsuit noted that state law wasn't clear on what constitutes an address for witnesses.  A Waukesha County judge sided with Republicans in 2022 and ruled that election clerks can’t fill in missing address information on absentee ballot envelopes. The elections commission withdrew its guidance following that ruling.  However, the judge did not say in that order what constitutes an address.  That led to the filing of a pair of related lawsuits in Dane County, which argued that because there was no longer any state guidance, and the Waukesha County ruling didn’t say what counts as a complete address, clerks didn’t know what to do.  The lawsuits were filed by Rise Inc., a liberal group that mobilizes young voters, and the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.  The judge on Tuesday spelled out four ways a witness address could be accepted with some missing information.  He said that a witness address can be accepted if it includes the street number, street name and municipality, but neither a state name nor a ZIP code or with everything except a municipality and state name. It would also be acceptable if the witness includes the same street number and street name as the voter, but no other address information is provided.  And it would also be allowed if the witness indicates their address is the same as the voter's by saying “same,” “same address,” “same as voter,” “same as above,” “see above,” “ditto,” or by using quotation marks or an arrow or line pointing to the other address.  The Legislative Audit Bureau in 2021 reviewed nearly 15,000 absentee ballot envelopes from the 2020 election across 29 municipalities and found that 1,022, or about 7%, were missing parts of witness addresses. Only 15 ballots, or 0.1%, had no witness address. Auditors found that clerks had corrected addresses on 66 envelopes, or 0.4% of the sample.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Judge Orders Wisconsin Elections Officials to Move Quickly on Changing Absentee Ballot Rules,2 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
2,https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/sheets/best-deep-pocket-sheets,"Things To Consider When Buying Deep-Pocket Sheets  Pocket Depth: The pocket depth you need depends on your particular mattress, so make sure you measure or check the specs of your mattress before you buy your sheets. This will help you determine if you need deep (16- to 18-inch) or extra-deep (19- to 22-inch) deep-pocket sheets. Additionally, check the specs of the sheets before you make your choice. Some products advertised as “deep-pocket” won’t actually fit taller mattresses.  While some bedding makers say any extra pocket material can be tucked under the mattress and forgotten about, frequent customer complaints with deep-pocket sheets are regarding them sliding up and getting bunched under sleepers or wrinkling unpleasantly. Because of this, we recommend getting as close to your mattress size as you can (while still leaving a couple of inches to allow for shrinkage) and looking for options with strong elastic bands to further prevent slipping and bunching. This will also help increase the lifespan of the sheets.  Material: When it comes to sheets, not only are natural fibers more breathable but less likely to irritate skin sensitivities. Synthetic sheets, such as those made of polyester, are usually dyed with azo disperse dyes, which are common causes of skin irritation. Common natural-fiber sheet options include cotton, linen, hemp, silk, bamboo, and eucalyptus.  Cotton works great for many sleepers, as it’s durable, comfortable, and breathable. However, not all cotton is the same. There are many different types of cotton, such as Pima, Supima, Egyptian, and Suvin. These fibers vary in staple length, which impacts the strength and softness of their weave when manufactured.  If you’re a hot or sweaty sleeper, bamboo or eucalyptus-based materials may be best for you. Not only do they have the breathable qualities of natural fibers, but they’re also naturally cooling and moisture-wicking. Look for fabrics like Lyocell or viscose, which are akin to brand names for these materials.  Thread Count: While thread count is a common draw for consumers looking for the best sheets, more threads don’t automatically mean better or softer sheets. What’s most important is the length of the fiber itself, as this impacts the strength of the weave.  Though it doesn’t directly translate to quality, there’s a minimum thread count to look out for. Anything less than 200 has the potential to be rougher, which could be uncomfortable, but anything more than 400 is likely to be exaggerated unless the fiber used is of an extra-long length. This is partially why materials crafted with long fibers, such as Suvin cotton and Egyptian cotton, are softer and more durable (and often more expensive).  In short, don’t just look at the thread count to make your decision – look at the quality of the natural fibers used in the material and the way it’s woven.  Certifications: In addition to choosing natural fibers, we recommend looking for certifications that prove the materials are organic and nontoxic. Your bedding comes in direct contact with your skin for hours at a time, so it can have a great impact on your health.  To be sure the cotton used in sheets is truly organic and free of pesticides, look for certifications like GOTS. For sheets that don’t contain any harmful dyes or finishes, look for Oeko-Tex or Made Safe certifications. If you’re concerned about animal welfare, you can also seek out Certified Vegan brands, such as Avocado.  Care Instructions: To make your sheets last as long as possible, you need to read and follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. This is more than likely to increase the lifespan of the product.  Most sheets can be easily machine-washed, but many need to be washed specifically in cold or hot water and/or on a delicate or gentle cycle. There may be additional instructions on how to keep them free of wrinkles, such as taking them out of the dryer and making the bed as soon as they’re finished or ironing them on a specific heat setting.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Best Deep-Pocket Sheets of 2024,7 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/sothebys-defeats-russian-oligarch-in-art-fraud-case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury on Tuesday ruled in favor of Sotheby's at a trial in which the Russian billionaire oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev accused the auction house of defrauding him out of tens of millions of dollars in art sales.  Rybolovlev accused Sotheby's of conspiring with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier to trick him into paying inflated prices for four works including ""Salvator Mundi,"" a depiction of Christ attributed to Leonardo da Vinci that would become the most expensive artwork sold at auction.  Sotheby's, which is privately held, had long maintained that it had no knowledge that Bouvier might have lied, and that it was not liable for his dealings with Rybolovlev.  Bouvier was not a defendant, and has maintained he did nothing wrong.  Rybolovlev, 57, is worth $6.4 billion after building his fortune in potash fertilizer, according to Forbes magazine. He is also majority owner of the AS Monaco soccer team, though has been reported this year to be exploring a sale.  Daniel Kornstein, a lawyer for Rybolovlev, said the case ""achieved our goal of shining a light on the lack of transparency that plagues the art market. That secrecy made it difficult to prove a complex aiding and abetting fraud case.""  Sotheby's said the verdict reaffirmed its commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity, ethics and professionalism, and reflected a ""glaring lack of evidence"" that it cheated Rybolovlev.  The case has been among the highest-profile art fraud disputes in recent years, offering a view into an often secretive industry where wealthy buyers sometimes don't know who they are buying from.  Jurors in Manhattan federal court needed less than a day to reach a verdict, in a trial that lasted about three weeks.  U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman had last March let Rybolovlev pursue fraud-based claims over the da Vinci, and works by Gustav Klimt, Rene Magritte and Amedeo Modigliani.  Rybolovlev originally sued over 15 pieces of world-class art for which he paid more than $1 billion, and accused Bouvier of charging hundreds of millions of dollars in hidden markups.  Furman dismissed fraud-based claims over the other 11 works, including art from Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.  Rybolovlev was allowed to sue over ""Salvator Mundi"" even though his ownership had proven unusually profitable.  According to court papers, Bouvier bought the da Vinci for $83 million in 2013 and sold it the next day to Rybolovlev for $127.5 million.  Rybolovlev went on to sell ""Salvator Mundi"" at Christie's in 2017 for $450.3 million, a record price for an artwork at auction.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index released on Tuesday registered a 0.2% dip for the month but also a 5.1% annual gain following a 4.7% increase in October. It was the first drop since January 2023.  “U.S. home prices edged downward from their all-time high in November,” said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real estate and digital assets at Dow Jones Indices. “The streak of nine monthly gains ended in November, setting the index back to levels last seen over the summer months.”    The Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images  Seattle and San Francisco led the cities with the largest monthly declines of 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Six cities – Miami, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, New York and Cleveland – posted new all-time highs in November.  However, Luke said, “The days of markets in the South rising double digits with markets in the Midwest remaining flat are over. The house price decline came at a time where mortgage rates peaked, with the average Freddie Mac 30-year fixed rate mortgage nearing 8%, according to Federal Reserve data. The rate has since fallen over 1%, which could support further annual gains in home prices.”    Prices have remained high even as mortgage rates have risen, largely because of a limited inventory of homes for sale. Existing homeowners have been reluctant to put their houses on the market as they enjoy mortgages taken out during the pandemic and earlier when interest costs were low.  But as more inventory comes on the market and mortgage rates remain elevated, sale prices may be beginning to wilt. Realtors report more haggling between buyers and selling of late.    Mortgages surged in the fall to near 8% for the benchmark 30-year fixed rate loan but have since dipped back to the 6% range. That has led some analysts to say that the market could bounce back as the traditional spring buying season begins.  “With mortgage rates now lower and spring home buying demand already lurking, home prices will continue to rise, especially considering the outsized pent-up demand for homes coming from young buyers, those who have been waiting for lower rates, and huge influx of immigrants over the last couple of years,” said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic.    The index tracks a three-month period when mortgage rates were zig-zagging and ended on a down note, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Home Prices Come Off Their Highs, Post Slight Monthly Decline",8 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

She used the money to finish home improvements and buy a new car for her growing family.  Then a letter arrived from the Oklahoma State Department of Education: It told her she received the money in error and must repay it, quickly.  “I don't obviously have the money to pay it back by the end of February,” Stadelman said. “I came home the day I found out and just cried for two days straight.""  The errant payments, first reported by Oklahoma Watch, and the repayment demands have Oklahoma's education agency drawing fierce criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, some of whom say teachers shouldn't be forced to give the money back. Average teacher pay in Oklahoma is about $54,800, which ranks 38th in the country, according to the National Education Association.  The bonuses were awarded under an Oklahoma program that is intended to help recruit new teachers for the most difficult jobs to fill, including early elementary and special education. In the wake of the mishap, Oklahoma legislators are looking to overhaul the program to prevent paying the bonuses in a lump sum and implement a more rigorous screening process.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  A department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on how many bonuses were paid in error or how it intends to claw them back. Oklahoma Watch reported that at least nine teachers were asked to return bonuses ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. A total of $185,000 went to teachers who didn't qualify for the program at all, and $105,000 was overpaid to teachers who qualified for a lesser amount, the outlet reported.  State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, who implemented the program, suggested in a memo sent Monday to legislative leaders that some of the errant bonuses were because teachers had “misrepresented their experience and qualifications.” He blamed the media for much of the fallout.  “The press has jumped the gun on their reporting, excluding vital details on the contracts and our auditing system,” Walters wrote in the memo, obtained by The Associated Press. “The fact of the matter is that over 500 teachers were recruited to Oklahoma classrooms through this program.”  Still, lawmakers from both parties have leveled fierce criticism at Walters and the agency.  “As a former teacher, I cannot imagine the anxiety something like this would induce — to be deemed eligible and to receive a large bonus in my bank account, only to be told months later I must return it,"" said state Rep. Rhonda Baker, a Yukon Republican and chair of the House Common Education Committee. “It was up to the State Department of Education to provide proper oversight in the vetting and approval of the bonus recipients.”  Stadelman told the AP that her bonus came to about $29,000 after taxes. She said her blood pressure spiked after she got the letter, which said she was ineligible because she had previously been employed as a full-time special education teacher in another district last year, even though she said she indicated that on her application.  It's not the first time that Walters, a conservative Republican who leads the department and who has embraced culture-war issues like book banning and targeting transgender students, has come under fire for alleged misspending of public funds.  A state audit of a federal COVID funds for the Governor's Emergency Education Relief fund, or GEER, during the time when Walters served as the governor's education secretary found more than $1.7 million was spent on non-educational items such as kitchen appliances, power tools, furniture and entertainment.  Walters also faced criticism after the news outlet The Frontier reported this month that he expensed more than $4,000 on travel for out-of-state speaking engagements, media appearances and a horror movie premiere, despite the governor's executive order banning public spending for most travel outside of Oklahoma.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Oklahoma Asks Teachers to Return up to $50,000 in Bonuses the State Says Were Paid in Error",5 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Here is a timeline of events related to the Nov. 5, 2024, election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.  2024  - Jan. 31: Federal Election Commission 2023 year-end filing deadline for candidates to declare the money they have raised and spent  - Feb. 3: Democratic presidential primary in South Carolina  - Feb. 6: Democratic primary in Nevada  - Feb. 6: Nikki Haley has filed to take part in the Nevada state-run primary, two days ahead of the Republican Party's caucuses in the state.  - Feb. 8: Nevada caucuses for Republicans  - Feb. 24: South Carolina Republican primary  - Feb. 27: Democrats and Republicans vote in the Michigan state-run primary, which was brought forward by the Democratic-controlled state in a move opposed by Republicans. Republicans will instead choose the majority of their delegates during caucuses in March.  - March 2: Republicans in Michigan pick most of their delegates during party-run caucuses.  - March 5: Known as Super Tuesday, this is the biggest single day of primaries and often helps whittle down the field of candidates.  Both parties hold them in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.  Democrats in Utah will also vote in their primary while Republicans hold their caucuses in the state. Republicans in Alaska vote in their primary.  Iowa Democrats hold the final day of their mail-in caucuses and U.S. territory American Samoa has its caucuses on this date too.  - March 12: Primaries held in the states of Georgia, Mississippi and Washington. Republicans in Hawaii hold caucuses.  - March 19: Primaries held in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.  - June 4: The final state primaries are scheduled for this date.  - July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate.  - Aug. 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the party formally chooses its candidate.  - Sept. 16: The date set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for the first presidential debate to take place. It will be held at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.  - Sept. 25: The date set for the only vice presidential debate, to be held at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.  - Oct. 1: The date set for the second presidential debate, to be held at Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia.  - Oct. 9: The date set for the third and final presidential debate, to be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.  - Nov. 5: Election Day  - Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.  2025  - Jan. 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.  Ahead of the count on Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters and some people chanted, ""hang Mike Pence"" as they tried to stop the count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.

Bush, a member of the high-profile group of House progressives nicknamed ""The Squad,"" said in a statement that she had faced threats even before she was sworn into office in January 2021 and had used campaign funds for security. She denied wrongdoing.  ""As a rank-and-file member of Congress I am not entitled to personal protection by the House,"" Bush said in a statement. ""I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services.""  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Bush said the allegations focused on her husband's role on the campaign, adding that he had been a part of her security team due to his experience in the area.  The Federal Elections Commission and the House Ethics Committee are also probing her campaign, Bush said. The Office of Congressional Ethics also conducted a months-long investigation and found no wrongdoing, she said.  The Office of Congressional Ethics declined to provide details about whether it had conducted an investigation.  On Monday, a formal communication was read on the House floor stating that the House Sergeant at Arms had been served with a grand jury subpoena and was complying with it. It did not provide details about the case. The Office of the House Sergeant at Arms did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Bush has spoken of facing economic hardship before her election to office, including being evicted three times and living in her car with her children for a while. In July 2021, she spent a night on the steps of the Capitol to protest the end of a COVID-era freeze on evictions.  In 2023 she brought Michael Brown Sr. as her guest to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. He is the father of Michael Brown, whose 2014 shooting by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer helped give birth to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Nick Ejak, who was in charge of discipline at Oxford High School, said he was concerned about Ethan Crumbley's mental health but did not consider him to be a threat to others on Nov. 30, 2021.  After the meeting about the drawing, the teen's parents declined to take their son home. A few hours later, he pulled a 9mm gun from his backpack and shot 11 people inside the school.  Jennifer Crumbley, 45, is charged with involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors say she and her husband were grossly negligent and could have prevented the four deaths if they had tended to their son’s mental health. They’re also accused of making a gun accessible at home.  Much of Ejak's testimony focused on the meeting that morning, which included him, the parents, the boy and a counselor. The school requested the meeting after a teacher found the drawing, which depicted a gun and a bullet and the lines, “The thoughts won't stop. Help me. The world is dead. My life is useless.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Ejak said he didn't have reasonable suspicion to search the teen's backpack, such as nervous behavior or allegations of vaping or possessing a weapon.  ""None of that was present,"" he told the jury, adding that the drawing also didn't violate the school's conduct code.  Ejak said he found it “odd” and “strange” that Jennifer and James Crumbley declined to immediately take their son home.  “My concern was he gets the help he needs,” Ejak said.  Jennifer Crumbley worked in marketing for a real estate company. Her boss, Andrew Smith, testified that the business was “very family friendly, family first,” an apparent attempt by prosecutors to show that she didn't need to rush back to work after the morning meeting at the school.  Smith said Jennifer Crumbley dashed out of the office when news of the shooting broke. She sent him text messages declaring that her son “must be the shooter. ... I need my job. Please don’t judge me for what my son did.”  “I was a little taken aback,” Smith said. “I was surprised she was worried about work.”  The jury saw police photos of the Crumbley home taken on the day of the shooting. Ethan's bedroom was messy, with paper targets from a shooting range displayed on a wall. The small safe that held the Sig Sauer handgun was open and empty on his parents' bed.  Ejak, the high school dean, said the parents didn't disclose that James Crumbley had purchased a gun as a gift for Ethan just four days earlier. Ejak also didn't know about the teen's hallucinations earlier in 2021.  “It would have completely changed the process that we followed. ... As an expert of their child, I heavily rely on the parents for information,” he said.  Near the end of the day, prosecutors played a video of Jennifer Crumbley sitting in a police car after the shooting. She sobbed at times, expressed disbelief about her son — he “ruined his life” — and asked for cigarettes.  “I don't get what happened,” she said.  James Crumbley, 47, will stand trial in March. The couple are the first parents in the U.S. to be charged in a mass school shooting committed by their child. Ethan, now 17, is serving a life sentence.  ___  Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Official Found It 'Strange' That Michigan School Shooter's Mom Didn't Take Him Home Over Drawing,5 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
1,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/philadelphia-police-release-video-in-corner-store-shooting-that-killed-suspect-wounded-officer,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Two Philadelphia police officers had their weapons holstered before a scuffle with a man inside a corner deli when one of the officers was shot by a suspect who was then fatally shot by the wounded officer’s partner, the city’s police commissioner said Tuesday.  The department promised full “transparency” about the Friday night encounter inside a corner store and released several minutes of security video as concerns grew about the police use of force in the fatal shooting of 28-year-old Alexander Spencer. Two officers were wrestling with Spencer on the floor as two shots rang out in a five-second span.  At the same time, neither new Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel nor District Attorney Larry Krasner took questions at a morning news conference.  “The officers’ guns are holstered, and only after being shot do they take their weapon out,” Bethel said.  Krasner, a longtime civil rights lawyer who has clashed with police, said he had met with Spencer's family, and said they wanted the video released. Bethel said his staff had also met with the family.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The video shows two uniformed officers stopping in the narrow store as several men meander near a row of video gambling machines. The officers appear to confront Spencer about whether he has a gun, and the three begin wrestling.  “He alerts his partner that there’s a gun. And the struggle is on.” said Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore.  The injured officer, who was crouching, suffered four wounds when he was shot by a single bullet, Vanore said. He may have tried to fire back, but could not, he said.  “I think he tried, but it did not operate. The other officer did and that was the shot that struck Mr. Spencer,” Vanore said.  The suspect's gun appeared to kick out from the scrum, and was later grabbed by a man seen on video recording the scene with a cellphone. Police have a warrant out for his arrest, and have identified him as Jose Quinones-Mendez, 42. He is being sought on charges that include obstruction of justice and evidence tampering. The two officers apparently did not notice that the gun had slid away.  The officers, whose names have not yet been released, were on routine patrol in the area while also keeping an eye out for a person wanted in a recent non-fatal shooting, Bethel said. He described the immediate area, in the city's Fairhill neighborhood, as particularly dangerous, with five homicides and 17 nonfatal shootings in the past three years.  The commissioner, a department veteran recently appointed by new Mayor Cherelle Parker, said he has to send his officers to work every day in ""some of the places that have our greatest challenges.”  The injured officer was released Monday from a hospital, the department said.

This comes after the U.S. government on Monday pulled back part of the sanctions relief it granted Venezuela last year, following through on its threat to do so after Maduro reneged on a deal his administration made last year in Barbados with the Venezuelan opposition to hold free elections in 2024.  On Friday, Venezuela’s Supreme Court, aligned with Maduro’s government, upheld a ban on opposition leader María Corina Machado, a longtime government foe and winner of the primary held by the opposition faction backed by the U.S.  Machado, a former lawmaker, won the opposition’s independently-run presidential primary with more than 90% of the votes. Her victory came despite the government announcing a 15-year ban on her running for office just days after she formally entered the race in June.  A spokesperson for the National Security Council said the U.S. is clear about the path forward in support of democratic elections and is considering additional measures against the Maduro regime.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Monday gave companies doing business with Venezuela’s state-owned mining company until Feb. 13 to wind down operations.  The department had allowed transactions with the mining company in October after the Maduro government agreed to level the playing field ahead of this year’s presidential election. The deal narrowed the scheduling of the election to the second half of 2024 and called on both sides to “promote the authorization of all presidential candidates and political parties” to participate as long as they comply with the law.  Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, said the Barbados electoral roadmap is the most viable mechanism to resolving Venezuela’s longstanding political and economic problems.

3,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-01-30/us-job-openings-rose-in-december-pointing-to-a-still-durable-labor-market,"WASHINGTON (AP) — America's employers posted 9 million job openings in December, an increase from November and another sign that the U.S. job market remains resilient despite the headwind of higher interest rates.  The number of openings was up from November's 8.9 million, which itself was revised up in Tuesday's report from the government. Job openings have gradually but steadily declined since peaking at a record 12 million in March 2022. But they remain at historically high levels: Before 2021, monthly openings had never topped 8 million.  Still, in a cautionary sign, layoffs rose in December. And the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of relative confidence in their ability to find a better position — dipped to the lowest level since January 2021.  The U.S. economy and job market have remained surprisingly durable despite sharply higher interest rates, which have led to higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. The Federal Reserve's policymakers raised their benchmark interest rate 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, bringing it to a 23-year high of around 5.4%.  The Fed wants to see the job market cool from the red-hot levels of 2021 and 2022, thereby reducing pressure on businesses to raise pay to attract and keep staff — and to pass on those costs to customers through higher prices.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Higher rates have contributed to a slowdown in hiring, though the pace of job growth remains relatively healthy: U.S. employers added 2.7 million jobs last year, down from 4.8 million in 2022 and a record 7.3 million in 2021. When the government issues the January employment report on Friday, it is expected to show that employers added a solid 177,000 jobs, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.  The job market is cooling in a mostly painless way — through fewer openings. Despite a wave of high-profile layoffs, the number of job cuts across the economy remains relatively low.  The unemployment rate has come in below 4% for 23 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s. And the number of people applying for unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs — has remained unusually low.  At the same time, while inflation has sharply slowed after peaking in mid-2022, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.  The Fed has signaled that it expects to reverse course and cut rates three times this year, though it's set to leave rates unchanged after its latest policy meeting ends Wednesday. Financial markets have been anticipating the first rate cut as early as March, though continued strength in the job market might make the Fed's policymakers wary of acting before mid-year.  “These data — which show demand for workers remains robust — do not support imminent rate cuts,'' said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “They support a cautious approach going forward, so that policymakers can be sure that inflation"" will reach their 2% target.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","US Job Openings Rose in December, Pointing to a Still-Durable Labor Market",8 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
4,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-01-30/military-veteran-who-killed-iraqi-civilian-is-ordered-jailed-on-capitol-riot-charges,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A military veteran who shot and killed a handcuffed civilian in Iraq nearly 20 years ago was ordered jailed Tuesday on charges that he used a metal baton to assault police officers during a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Chief Judge James Boasberg agreed with prosecutors that Edward Richmond Jr., 40, of Geismar, Louisiana, is a danger to the community. Richmond initially was released after his Jan. 22 arrest.  FBI agents found an AR-15 assault rifle in Richmond's closet when they searched his Louisiana home. Richmond is prohibited from possessing firearms after his 2004 manslaughter conviction for fatally shooting an Iraqi cow herder in the head while serving in the U.S. Army.  “The government is concerned that, under growing pressure, he may snap again,” a prosecutor wrote in a court filing.  The judge described Richmond's conduct at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as “pretty troubling to me.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The prosecutor said Richmond was trying to live “off the grid” with untraceable income before his arrest on charges including civil disorder and assaulting police with a dangerous weapon. But the judge said he didn't view Richmond as a flight risk, as prosecutors argued.  Last Wednesday, a federal magistrate judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ordered Richmond's release from custody. Prosecutors persuaded Boasberg to overrule the magistrate's decision.  The judge ordered Richmond to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Service next Monday. Richmond is the sole caregiver for his 16-year-old son. The judge agreed to give Richmond time to make arrangements for his son's care while he is in jail.  “I know it's important to you. It's important to me also,” the judge told Richmond, who appeared remotely with his Louisiana-based attorney, John McLindon.  McLindon said prosecutors are relying on “antiquated incidents” in Richmond’s life to argue that he is a danger to the community.  “There is not one shred of evidence that in the last three years he has engaged in any type of violence or crimes. He has simply worked and raised his son,” the defense attorney wrote.  Richmond was 20 when an Army court-martial panel convicted him of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to three years of military confinement for killing Muhamad Husain Kadir in February 2004. Richmond also was dishonorably discharged from the Army.  The Army said Richmond shot Kadir in the back of the head from about six feet away after the man stumbled. Richmond testified that he didn’t know Kadir was handcuffed and believed the Iraqi man was going to harm a fellow soldier.  Richmond initially was charged with unpremeditated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. But the panel of five officers and five enlisted soldiers reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter.  Richmond was dressed in tactical gear when he attacked police outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit.  Body camera footage captured Richmond repeatedly assaulting police officers with a black baton in a tunnel on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace, the FBI said. Police struggled for hours to stop a mob of Donald Trump supporters from entering the Capitol through the same tunnel entrance.  “January 6 was not a one-time, innocent mistake, but rather one example of a pattern of dangerous behavior; of responding to tense situations with violence,"" wrote the prosecutor, Victoria Sheets.  Sheets said the rifle found in Richmond's home was registered to his ex-wife. Prosecutors plan to charge Richmond with a crime in connection with the gun, Sheets said.  “He knows he's not supposed to have this weapon,” she told the judge. “He knows what those weapons can do.”  A witness helped the FBI identify Richmond as somebody who had traveled to Washington with several other people to serve as a “security team” for the witness for rallies planned for Jan. 6, the affidavit says.  Over 100 police officers were injured during the riot. More than 1,200 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol attack.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Military Veteran Who Killed Iraqi Civilian Is Ordered Jailed on Capitol Riot Charges,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Leaders from government, the arts, academia and philanthropy gathered in Washington for “Healing, Bridging, Thriving: A Summit on Arts and Culture in our Communities."" Panel discussions focused on turning to the arts and humanities to solve challenges, from improving health to bridging divides.  Neera Tanden, who advises the Democratic president on domestic policy issues, said in an interview with The Associated Press before the summit that the arts help “people to see each other and understand how we're connected,” which can help “mend the social fabric of the country.”  Maria Rosario Jackson, the NEA chair, in a separate interview said the conference is an “unprecedented opportunity for people from different sectors to come together and lift up and explore some of the things that are possible when one thinks of the arts as not being confined to a narrow sector, but woven and integrated into other things we care about.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Discussions focused on using the arts and humanities to improve health and infrastructure and promote a healthy democracy. Participants included soprano Renee Fleming and actor Anna Deavere Smith. Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, also participated.  Radhika Fox, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Water, announced the first-ever artist-in-residence program “to unleash the power of arts and culture to support water restoration and climate resilient efforts around the country.”  To start, artists will be embedded in national estuaries and urban waters federal partnerships in six regions of the country: Seattle, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, greater Philadelphia, Boston and the New York-New Jersey area. Each watershed will receive $200,00 to support the artist.  Jackson and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will co-chair a new government-wide working group on the arts, health and civic infrastructure, working with federal agencies to find ways to include the arts and humanities in these areas. HHS and the NEA have a long history of working together to improve health using the arts, including through music, Becerra said.  NEA is also committing $5 million for an initiative to support the work of artists and arts organizations that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals and communities.  Separately, the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities are collaborating on United We Stand: Connecting through Culture, an initiative that leverages the arts and humanities to combat hate-fueled violence. The program was launched in 2023, a year after Biden convened a similarly named summit at the White House focused on countering violence motivated by hate.  NEH committed $3 million to the program in 2023, and NEA is offering an additional $2 million.  Shelly Lowe, chair of the NEH, said art has an important role to play in the humanities.  “Art gives you a good sense of people's cultures. That's through painting, that's through food, that's through performances and music,” Lowe said in an interview before the summit. “They're so tied together it's hard to separate the two.”  Biden's executive order said the arts, humanities and museum and library services are essential to the well-being, health, vitality and democracy of the nation.  “They are the soul of America,” Biden wrote in the order, adding that, under his leadership, they “will be integrated into strategies, policies and programs that advance the economic development, well-being and resilience of all communities, especially those that have historically been underserved.”  Emhoff, a former Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, helped close the summit. He said that as a practicing attorney he saw “first hand how art and film and music can help build and foster community.”  “Arts help us build empathy, strengthen mutual understanding and inspire change, and that’s why, especially at a time like this, the time that we’re facing right now, we need to use the arts and humanities to help us counteract ideological extremes so we can build human connections.” he said.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",White House-Hosted Arts Summit Explores How to Incorporate Arts and Humanities Into Problem-Solving,5 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Jean Carroll's two successful civil defamation trials against the former U.S. president might have had a conflict of interest.  In a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, Trump's lawyer Alina Habba said she was satisfied that the judge and Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related, did not have a ""mentor-mentee relationship"" when they worked at the same law firm three decades ago.  Habba had on Monday suggested that such a relationship might have tainted the $83.3 million jury award that Carroll, a former Elle magazine advice columnist, won against Trump last Friday.  She cited a Jan. 27 New York Post article that quoted an unnamed former partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as saying Judge Kaplan had been ""like a mentor"" to Roberta Kaplan when both worked for about two years at the firm.  In a letter on Tuesday, Roberta Kaplan called it ""utterly baseless"" to suggest there had been such a relationship, and said she might seek sanctions if Habba kept making ""false accusations of impropriety.""  Habba indicated that Kaplan's letter appeared to settle the matter.  ""The point of my January 29 letter was to verify whether the information contained in the New York Post article is accurate,"" she wrote. ""Since Ms. Kaplan has now denied that there was ever a mentor-mentee relationship between herself and Your Honor, this issue has seemingly been resolved.""  A spokesperson for Roberta Kaplan declined to comment.  Trump plans to appeal the $83.3 million verdict, which stemmed from his June 2019 denials that he raped Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.  He is appealing a $5 million award to Carroll by a different jury last May, which found Trump liable for a similar October 2022 defamation and for sexual abuse.  The first jury's findings were binding for the second trial, leaving the jury there to focus only on damages.  Trump's legal team has argued that Carroll suffered no harm, and enjoyed the fame and attention her case drew.  In Tuesday's letter, Habba stood by her comments that Judge Kaplan's ""overtly hostile"" treatment of Trump's side and ""preferential"" treatment of Carroll's side could also support an appeal.

Rybolovlev accused Sotheby's of conspiring with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier to trick him into paying inflated prices for four works including ""Salvator Mundi,"" a depiction of Christ attributed to Leonardo da Vinci that would become the most expensive artwork sold at auction.  Sotheby's, which is privately held, had long maintained that it had no knowledge that Bouvier might have lied, and that it was not liable for his dealings with Rybolovlev.  Bouvier was not a defendant, and has maintained he did nothing wrong.  Rybolovlev, 57, is worth $6.4 billion after building his fortune in potash fertilizer, according to Forbes magazine. He is also majority owner of the AS Monaco soccer team, though has been reported this year to be exploring a sale.  Daniel Kornstein, a lawyer for Rybolovlev, said the case ""achieved our goal of shining a light on the lack of transparency that plagues the art market.

Sotheby's said the verdict reaffirmed its commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity, ethics and professionalism, and reflected a ""glaring lack of evidence"" that it cheated Rybolovlev.  The case has been among the highest-profile art fraud disputes in recent years, offering a view into an often secretive industry where wealthy buyers sometimes don't know who they are buying from.  Jurors in Manhattan federal court needed less than a day to reach a verdict, in a trial that lasted about three weeks.  U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman had last March let Rybolovlev pursue fraud-based claims over the da Vinci, and works by Gustav Klimt, Rene Magritte and Amedeo Modigliani.  Rybolovlev originally sued over 15 pieces of world-class art for which he paid more than $1 billion, and accused Bouvier of charging hundreds of millions of dollars in hidden markups.  Furman dismissed fraud-based claims over the other 11 works, including art from Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.  Rybolovlev was allowed to sue over ""Salvator Mundi"" even though his ownership had proven unusually profitable.  According to court papers, Bouvier bought the da Vinci for $83 million in 2013 and sold it the next day to Rybolovlev for $127.5 million.  Rybolovlev went on to sell ""Salvator Mundi"" at Christie's in 2017 for $450.3 million, a record price for an artwork at auction.

9,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/study-confirms-link-between-smoking-and-als,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- New research is helping confirm smoking as a risk factor for the devastating brain illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  ALS affects roughly 31,000 Americans each year, with about 5,000 new cases diagnosed annually, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's a progressive, fatal illness that causes nerves cells controlling muscles to slowly die, leading to weakness and paralysis.  The causes of ALS are unknown, and even risk factors for the disease remain unclear.  In their new research, a team from South Korea looked at the data from 32 different studies for possible links between smoking and ALS.  They found that people who had smoked had a 12% higher odds of developing ALS compared to those who hadn't, with risks rising even higher if the person was a current smoker.  “One of our most pivotal findings was the dose-response analysis, revealing an inverted U-shaped curve,” said study lead author Dr. Yun Hak Kim, of the department of biomedical informatics at Pusan National University in Busan, Korea.  According to Kim, a U-shaped curve means that the “risk associated with smoking isn't a linear progression.""  ""Instead, it peaks and then starts to decrease or plateau, suggesting that the risk of ALS is influenced by the intensity of smoking,"" he said in a university news release.  Gender seemed to play a role as well.  The link between smoking and ALS appeared stronger for women smokers, who had a 20% higher odds for the disease than women who hadn't smoked. After adjusting for other potential risk factors, that added risk rose to 25%, the study found.  The findings were published in the January issue of the journal Tobacco Induced Diseases.  There are lots of great reasons to quit smoking, and now ""encouraging individuals to discontinue smoking is crucial, given its tangible impact on reducing the likelihood of ALS onset,"" the researchers said.

But there's some unexpected good news: The rate of new gonorrhea cases fell for the first time in a decade.  It's not clear why syphilis rose 9% while gonorrhea dropped 9%, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, adding that it's too soon to know whether a new downward trend is emerging for the latter.  They are most focused on syphilis, which is less common than gonorrhea or chlamydia but considered more dangerous. Total cases surpassed 207,000 in 2022, the highest count in the United States since 1950, according to data released Tuesday.  And while it continues to have a disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men, it is expanding in heterosexual men and women, and increasingly affecting newborns, too, CDC officials said.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Syphilis is a bacterial disease that can surface as painless genital sores but can ultimately lead to paralysis, hearing loss, dementia and even death if left untreated.  New syphilis infections plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when antibiotics became widely available and fell to their lowest by 1998.  About 59,000 of the 2022 cases involved the most infectious forms of syphilis. Of those, about a quarter were women and nearly a quarter were heterosexual men.  “I think it's unknowingly being spread in the cisgender heterosexual population because we really aren’t testing for it. We really aren't looking for it” in that population, said Dr. Philip Chan, who teaches at Brown University and is chief medical officer of Open Door Health, a health center for gay, lesbian and transgender patients in Providence, Rhode Island.  The report also shows rates of the most infectious types of syphilis rose not just across the country but also across different racial and ethnic groups, with American Indian and Alaska Native people having the highest rate. South Dakota outpaced any other state for the highest rate of infectious syphilis at 84 cases per 100,000 people — more than twice as high as the state with the second-highest rate, New Mexico.  South Dakota's increase was driven by an outbreak in the Native American community, said Dr. Meghan O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board based in Rapid City, South Dakota. Nearly all of the cases were in heterosexual people, and O'Connell said that STD testing and treatment was already limited in isolated tribal communities and only got worse during the pandemic.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year convened a syphilis task force focused on stopping the spread of the STD, with an emphasis on places with the highest syphilis rates — South Dakota, 12 other states and the District of Columbia.  The report also looked at the more common STDs of chlamydia and gonorrhea.  Chlamydia cases were relatively flat from 2021 to 2022, staying at a rate of about 495 per 100,000, though there were declines noted in men and especially women in their early 20s. For gonorrhea, the most pronounced decline was seen in women in their early 20s as well.  Experts say they're not sure why gonorrhea rates declined. It happened in about 40 states, so whatever explains the decrease appears to have occurred across most of the country. STD testing was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and officials believe that's the reason the chlamydia rate fell in 2020.  It's possible that testing and diagnoses were still shaking out in 2022, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention.  “We are encouraged by the magnitude of the decline,” Mermin said, though the gonorrhea rate is still higher now than it was pre-pandemic.

1,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-01-30/chatgpt-violated-european-privacy-laws-italy-tells-chatbot-maker-openai,"LONDON (AP) — Italian regulators said they told OpenAI that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot has violated European Union’s stringent data privacy rules.  The country's data protection authority, known as Garante, said Monday that it notified San Francisco-based OpenAI of breaches of the EU rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation.  The watchdog started investigating ChatGPT last year, when it temporarily banned within Italy the chatbot that can produce text, images and sound in response to users' questions.  Based on the results of its “fact-finding activity,"" the watchdog said it “concluded that the available evidence pointed to the existence of breaches of the provisions” in the EU privacy rules.  OpenAI, which has 30 days to reply to the allegations, said it would work constructively with Italian regulators.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “We believe our practices align with GDPR and other privacy laws, and we take additional steps to protect people’s data and privacy,"" a company statement said. ""We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals. We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT, which also rejects requests for private or sensitive information about people.”  The company said last year that it fulfilled a raft of conditions that the Garante demanded to get the ChatGPT ban lifted.  The watchdog had imposed the ban after finding that some users’ messages and payment information were exposed and because ChatGPT didn't have a system to verify users’ ages, allowing children to get answers from the AI tool that were inappropriate for their age.  It also questioned whether there was a legal basis for OpenAI to collect massive amounts of data used to train ChatGPT’s algorithms and raised concerns that the system could sometimes generate false information about individuals.  The growing popularity of generative AI systems like ChatGPT are also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry last week into the relationships between AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic and the tech giants that have bankrolled them — Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Competition regulators in the 27-nation EU and Britain, meanwhile, are also examining Microsoft's OpenAI investments.  AI systems also face broader oversight in the EU, which is finalizing its groundbreaking AI Act, the world's first comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence.

State Rep. Richard Smith, a Columbus Republican who chaired the House Rules Committee, died at his home from complications of the flu before dawn Tuesday, the House Speaker's office said.  Smith, 78, was first elected to the House in 2004 and was serving his 10th term in the General Assembly representing the 139th District, which included parts of Muscogee and Harris counties. He had been the chairman of the House Rules Committee since 2020. That key leadership post controls what legislation is considered by the full House.  “You never had to wonder where he stood with Richard Smith, did you?"" said Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington, who entered the House with Smith in 2005. ""He was always honest. But he was a compassionate person about his honesty.”  Smith's desk in the 180-member chamber was draped in black, with Rules and some other committees canceling meetings. A hush fell over the oft-noisy chamber Tuesday morning as Georgia Gov.

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/injected-opdivo-for-kidney-cancer-works-equally-well-as-iv-form-study,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Opdivo, one of the new generation of immunotherapy cancer treatments, appears to help kidney cancer patients equally well when given as a quick injection versus the current method of intravenous delivery, a new study finds.  The results of the new trial using injected Opdivo (nivolumab) could free up time and money for cancer patients, the research team said.  “The burden of treatment felt by cancer patients is tremendous. If nivolumab can be given as a subcutaneous [below the skin] injection instead of an intravenous infusion, patients’ treatment experience will be significantly improved,” said study lead author Dr. Saby George.  “Instead of one hour in an infusion chair, they will get the injection done in five minutes,"" said George, a professor of oncology and medicine and director of network clinical trials at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y.  His team presented the findings Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco. The trial was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol Myers Squibb.  In the study, George and his colleagues followed outcomes for 495 people with advanced or metastatic kidney cancers who were treated at 73 different cancer care centers across 17 countries, including Roswell Park.  All of the patients were new to an immunotherapy drug like Opdivo, although they may have already tried up to two types of standard chemotherapy.  Half of the patients got Opdivo in the standard way: Visiting an infusion center for about an hour. The other half received the drug via a quick injection.  Daily blood levels of the drug were tracked for 28 days after receiving it, and no significant differences were found between injected and IV delivery, according to the study.  Furthermore, patients appeared to benefit from Opdivo regardless of how it was delivered.  For example, the percentage of patients who achieved at least a ""partial response"" from the drug was about 24% for those it got the injection vs. about 18% of those who received it via IV drip.  Progression-free survival -- the time elapsed with no sign of cancer progression -- was about 7.2 months for patients who got injected Opdivo versus about 5.6 months for those who received it via IV, the team reported.  Opdivo is FDA-approved for more than 20 purposes across multiple cancer types, so its success with kidney cancer patients may be only the beginning, the researchers noted.  “This is a groundbreaking achievement for patients and physicians, and will definitely make treatment easier for patients,” George said in a Roswell Park news release.  “If nivolumab becomes available subcutaneously, we can administer it in the clinic instead of sending patients to infusion centers,” he said. That might lower drug wait times for patients generally.  It might also reduce disparities between urban and rural cancer patients.  ""One of the major problems is access to treatment,” George explained. “Patients who don’t live near an infusion center could get treatment closer to home, at a clinic, and that could improve access and help reduce disparities.”  Because the new findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

5,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/experimental-pain-med-could-give-patients-new-option-to-opioids,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- The first new kind of pain medication in over two decades could be on the horizon for patients, with promising results announced Tuesday from a company trial.  For now, the drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals is called VX-548. But in trials of patients undergoing abdominoplasties (tummy tucks) and foot bunion surgeries, VX-548 performed better than placebo at easing post-op pain, with no major safety issues seen.  It didn't bring superior pain relief compared with the opioid Vicodin (hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen), the trial found, but it scored similarly to Vicodin on a standard measure called the Numeric Pain Rating Scale.  “We are very pleased with the results from the VX-548 pivotal program, which demonstrate a compelling and consistent combination of efficacy and safety across multiple acute pain conditions and settings,"" Vertex President and CEO Dr. Reshma Kewalramani said in a company statement.  She noted that the drug is already being fast-tracked for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, and said Vertex is ""working with urgency to ... bring this non-opioid medicine to the millions of patients who suffer from acute pain each year in the U.S.”  Millions of patients worldwide are in need of some kind of alternative to opioid medications, which work well to ease pain but come with serious risks for addiction and abuse.  “As a physician treating patients suffering from pain for many years, I know firsthand the critical need for new, efficacious and safe treatment options,” Dr. Jessica Oswald, an associate physician in emergency medicine and pain medicine at the University of California, San Diego, said in the Vertex news release. She's also a member of the Vertex Acute Pain Steering Committee.  She called the findings on VX-548 ""impressive,"" with the ""potential to change the paradigm of pain management. I look forward to the potential of having a new class of acute pain medicine -- the first in more than two decades -- to use as an alternative to opioids to help the millions of people impacted by acute pain.”  Just how does VX-548 work?  As the company explained, the drugs doesn't work directly on the brain, but instead targets cellular processes within the peripheral nervous system.  More specifically, VX-548 targets a cellular mechanism called a sodium channel, in this case sodium channel NaV1.8.  NaV1.8 ""plays a critical role in pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system,"" Vertex said.  In the new trial, Vertex enrolled about 1,100 people who'd undergone tummy tuck surgeries, and a similar number who'd had bunion surgeries.  Patients got either a placebo, Vicodin (every six hours for 42 hours) or VX-548 -- first at a dose of 100 milligrams (mg) and then again at a 50-mg dose every 12 hours for the next 36 hours. All were given in pill form.  On a standard measure gauging patients' pain intensity, VX-548 had scores that easily outperformed the placebo.  Compared to Vicodin, VX-548 was roughly equal in pain relief for the abdominoplasty patients, and less effective than Vicodin among the foot surgery patients.  But using the the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, VX-548 and Vicodin showed similar pain reductions: 47% and 43%, respectively, for the tummy tuck patients, and 51% and 53%, respectively, for people who underwent the bunion surgeries.  As for safety, ""VX-548 was generally well-tolerated in this study,"" the company said. ""The majority of adverse events [AEs] were mild to moderate,"" with the most common issues involving nausea or constipation.

7,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-01-30/europes-economic-blahs-drag-on-with-zero-growth-at-the-end-of-last-year,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe’s economy failed to expand at the end of 2023, dragging out the stagnation for more than a year amid higher energy prices, costlier credit and a downturn in former powerhouse Germany.  Zero economic growth for the October-to-December period of last year follows a 0.1% contraction in the three months before that, according to figures released Tuesday by EU statistics agency Eurostat.  That extends a miserable run of economic blahs: The 20 countries that use the euro currency have not shown significant growth since the third quarter of 2022, when the economy grew 0.5%.  And the start of this year looks no better, with indicators of business activity still flashing red for contraction. Plus, disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea have constricted global trade through the Suez Canal, a major route between Asia and Europe, surging shipping costs and threatening to boost inflation.  The new figures underlined the growing divide between Europe and the United States, whose economy grew 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period, or an annual pace of 3.3% — better than expected.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The eurozone grew 0.5% for the full year, while the U.S. grew 2.5%. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday upgraded its outlook for the world economy this year, envisioning global growth of 3.1% led by the U.S. but downgrading expectations for the eurozone to a meager 0.9% expansion.  “The big picture is that eurozone GDP has been flat since the third quarter of 2022 when gas prices surged and the ECB started raising interest rates,” Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said in a written analysis.  Not all the news is bad. For one thing, unemployment is at record lows and the number of jobs rose in the July-to-September quarter.  Energy prices also have come down from recent spikes — though they remain higher than before Russia invaded Ukraine — and storage levels of natural gas, which is used to heat homes, power factories and generate electricity, are robust. With gas storage 72% full and most of the winter heating season nearly over, fears of higher utility bills and another energy crisis have eased.  While the economy has stagnated, inflation also has declined rapidly from its painful double-digit peak, falling to 2.9% in December. But people's pay and purchasing power are still catching up to the levels lost through the price surge.  It's seen as French farmers pushing for better pay, fewer constraints and lower costs have set up barricades around Paris this week.  Meanwhile, the anti-inflation medicine applied by the European Central Bank — sharply higher interest rates — has curbed business investment and real estate activity like construction and home sales.  Europe's biggest economy, Germany, shrank 0.3% in the fourth quarter. Formerly a model in how to grow, Germany was one of the worst-performing major developed economies last year.  It is bogged down with multiple issues including higher fuel prices for energy-intensive industries after Russia cut off most of its natural gas to the continent. Germany also has been held back by lack of skilled workers and years of underinvestment in infrastructure and digital technology in favor of balanced budgets.  While the incoming numbers for Europe “don't point to a significant improvement” and could signal a slight contraction in the first three months of this year, the eurozone should benefit from falling inflation that is restoring consumer purchasing power and expected lower interest rates, according to economists at Oxford Economics.  Some analysts expect the ECB to cut interest rates as early as April, while others think the central bank may wait until June to ensure inflation is definitely under control.  But risks remain, including the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, where 12% of global trade passes, amid Israel's war on Hamas.  Transport costs have risen as shipping companies route vessels around the southern tip of Africa, adding a week or more to voyages. With higher shipping costs and delays to products from clothes to keyboard components, concerns are growing of new consumer price spikes if the conflict in Gaza drags on or escalates.  The trade disruption could add as much as 0.5% to core inflation, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, Oxford Economics said.

The company also announced that it will bring back some plug-in gas-electric hybrids as electric vehicle sales growth slows.  The Detroit automaker made just over $10 billion last year, up from $8.9 billion in 2022. Excluding one-time items the company made $7.68 per share, easily surpassing the $7.57 projected on Wall Street, according to FactSet.  Full-year revenue was $171.84 billion, about 10% more than in 2022. That also beat estimates of $167.26 billion.  The company predicts a small improvement in earnings this year even as it plans for lower vehicle selling prices due to increased discounts.  Shares of General Motors Co. jumped 7.8% in Tuesday afternoon trading.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  GM said it expects net income will improve a little this year, to a range of $9.8 billion to $11.2 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $8.50 to $9.50, compared with $7.68 last year.  Due to $12.3 billion in North American pretax profits, about 45,000 members of the United Auto Workers will get profit-sharing checks of $12,250, the company said.  Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told reporters that GM is preparing for a 2% to 2.5% average sales price drop on vehicles this year compared to last year as inventory grows amid high interest rates. GM has planned for price cuts for the past couple of years, but they haven't materialized, he said.  “It's not actually what we're seeing in the market today,” Jacobson said, adding that average sale prices “are actually holding up very similar to where we saw the end of 2023.”  Prices are stable for both internal combustion and electric vehicles, he said, bucking industry trends. He said GM plans to keep a 50-to-60-day supply of vehicles at U.S. dealers, enough to supply demand but limit discounting.  That may be difficult with inventory from all automakers growing to 2.7 million at the end of last year, edging closer to pre-pandemic levels of around 3.5 million.  Without giving much detail, CEO Mary Barra said the company is bringing back some plug-in gas-electric hybrid models in the U.S., reversing a strategy to focus on electric vehicles. She told analysts on a conference call Tuesday that GM would resurrect the plug-in hybrid powertrains on selected vehicles in North America, in part to help comply with more stringent fuel economy requirements that will start in 2027 in the U.S.  Plug-in hybrids can go a relatively short distance on battery power before a gas-electric propulsion system kicks in.  GM, Barra said, is still committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from light duty vehicles by 2035. “But in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure,” she said.  She didn't give a date for the hybrid comeback, but said it can happen efficiently because the technology is already being produced in other markets.  Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive, said she has always disagreed with GM's strategy to stop selling hybrids in the U.S.  EVs require consumers to make a huge change in driving habits, especially when traveling, Krebs said. “A lot of people aren't ready for that,” she said. Hybrids, she said, still let people fill up at gas stations as they do now. “You've got that confidence that you can get places without charging up,” she said.  Growth in hybrid sales outpaced electric vehicle growth in the U.S. last year as environmentally conscious consumers bought them because of concerns over electric vehicle range and too few charging stations. Charging stations are being built with government incentives, and automakers are rolling out more EV models of all shapes and sizes.  GM struggled to produce electric vehicles in the past, so it will need to fall back on hybrids to meet fuel economy standards, Krebs said.  But Jacobson said there is still strong demand for GM's EV products that are on sale now. The company expects EV losses to ease this year and hit low-to-mid single digit profit margins in 2025 as it adds more EVs to its lineup.  GM plans to sell 200,000 to 300,000 EVs this year in North America, but Barra said it will adjust if needed. ""It’s true that the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand,” Jacobson said.  Jacobson also said that cost cutting by simplifying engineering and manufacturing saved GM about $1 billion last year, with another $1 billion expected this year.  During last year, GM lost $1.1 billion from the UAW strike, plus it booked $800 million in costs from a large Chevrolet Bolt EV battery recall. It also took a $1.7 billion accounting charge on the valuation of its electric vehicle inventory that is going to bring losses, Jacobson said. Those expenses won't occur in 2024, he said.  The company also expects to spend $1 billion less on its troubled Cruise autonomous vehicle unit as it slows the rollout of self-driving robotaxis. The company lost $2.7 billion before taxes at Cruise last year.  This year, the company expects $1.3 billion in higher labor costs and is prepared for about a $3 billion hit due to lower prices, Jacobson said.  In the fourth quarter, GM made $2.08 billion, up 4.5% from a year earlier. Without one-time items, the company made $1.24 per share, 8 cents more than analysts estimated.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","GM Made $10B Last Year Despite Autoworkers Strike, Says It Will Bring Back Plug-In Hybrids to US",6 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Instead of reducing taxes, the government should ensure it is prepared to meet increasing demands for spending on the National Health Service, social care and education as Britain faces sluggish economic growth and the lingering effects of high inflation, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters after the IMF released its latest outlook for the world economy.  U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt is widely expected to cut taxes in the coming months as part of an effort to boost support for his Conservative Party, which trails badly in most opinion polls. The next general election must be held by Jan. 28, 2025, and is expected to take place this year.  But Gourinchas said cutting taxes would be a mistake. Britain needs to make sure its finances are strong enough to accommodate increased spending demands without increasing debt as a proportion of economic output, he said.  “In that context, we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now,” Gourinchas said.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  His comments came after the IMF downgraded its outlook for the U.K. economy, forecasting growth of 0.6% this year and 1.6% in 2025. In October, the IMF forecast that the U.K.’s gross domestic product would grow 2% in 2025.  Hunt is focusing on longer-term projections, noting that the IMF expects growth to strengthen over the next few years.  “It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth,” he said.  Concerns about responsible fiscal policies are especially sensitive for Sunak and Hunt as they came to power after their predecessors were widely criticized for announcing millions of pounds in tax cuts without saying how they would be paid for.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Britain's Conservative Government Warned Against Tax Cuts by IMF Economist,7 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Their meeting was a hopeful sign of cooperation as the two global powers try to better manage their contentious ties.  The U.S. is seeking more information sharing and law enforcement cooperation and the designation and control of made-in-China chemicals that are ingredients for fentanyl made elsewhere, said Jen Daskal, a deputy homeland security advisor in the White House.  “Obviously we need to see the results and we need to see action,” she said in a phone interview after the meeting. “But there was a real spirit of cooperation and a commitment to working together.”  The first meeting of a new U.S.-China counternarcotics working group will be followed by more in-depth meetings in smaller groups on Wednesday. Fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is ravaging America, is a major focus, and in particular the ingredients and pill presses for the drug that come from China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to restart cooperation in drug trafficking and a handful of other areas when he and U.S. President Joe Biden met outside San Francisco in November. The agreements were a small step forward in a relationship strained by major differences on issues ranging from trade and technology to Taiwan and human rights.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The U.S. wants China to do more to curb the export of chemicals that it says are processed into fentanyl, largely in Mexico, before the final product is smuggled into the United States.  Chinese Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong said the two sides had in-depth and pragmatic talks.  ""We reached common understanding on the work plan for the working group,” he said at a ceremony marking the inauguration of the group.  Daskal said that Biden had sent a high-level delegation ""to underscore the importance of this issue to the American people.”  She said there have been some drops in shipments of fentanyl “precursors” from China since the Biden-Xi meeting and stressed the importance of information sharing to identify trends and keep up with fentanyl producers who come up with substitutes when supplies of a particular ingredient dry up.  “There’s a real sense of urgency,” she said, noting the high number of fentanyl-related fatalities in the United States and the violence, corruption and instability fueled by drug cartels around the world.  China used to be a major supplier of fentanyl, and the U.S. has credited Beijing for a 2019 crackdown that led to “a drastic reduction in seizures of fentanyl shipments ... from China.”  Synthetic opioids are the biggest killers in the deadliest drug crisis the U.S. has ever seen. More than 100,000 deaths were linked to drug overdoses in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than two-thirds involved fentanyl or similar synthetic drugs.  China had previously rebuffed U.S. appeals for help as relations between the two global powers deteriorated, often responding that the U.S. should look inward to solve its domestic problems and not blame them on China.  Talks were formally put on ice in 2022, when China suspended cooperation in several areas including narcotics to protest a visit to Taiwan by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The ice began to thaw in the lead-up to the Biden-Xi meeting in November 2023. A U.S. Senate delegation pressed the fentanyl issue on a visit to Beijing in October and said that Chinese officials expressed sympathy for the victims of America's opioid crisis.  But China refused to discuss cooperation unless the U.S. lifted sanctions on the Public Security Ministry's Institute of Forensic Science. The Commerce Department had imposed the sanctions in 2020, accusing the institute complicity in human rights violations against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in China’s Xinjiang region.  The U.S. quietly agreed to lift the sanctions to get cooperation on fentanyl. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged ""the removal of the obstacle of unilateral sanctions” in a speech on China-U.S. relations earlier this month.  State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called it “an appropriate step to take” given what China was willing to do on the trafficking of fentanyl precursors.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",US and China Launch Talks on Fentanyl Trafficking in a Sign of Cooperation Amid Differences,7 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Kaitlin Armstrong was convicted and sentenced to prison for 90 years in November for gunning down Wilson in Austin, Texas in a jealous rage. Investigators had been searching for Armstrong for more than a month and believed she was moving around Costa Rica looking for work as a yoga instructor.  In an interview with the CBS crime program “48 Hours,” Deputy U.S. Marshals Emir Perez and Damien Fernandez said they had run into dead ends in the beachside town of Santa Teresa before placing the ad on a local Facebook page seeking an instructor “as soon as possible.”  After several days of getting no responses, a woman finally answered and set up a meeting. That person turned out to be Armstrong.  She had cut and darkened her hair, and she had plastic surgery on her nose to change her appearance. Armstrong was still wearing a bandage on her face when Perez met the woman at a hostel and recognized Armstrong's eyes from photographs. Local police made the arrest, and she was returned to Texas for trial.

The company also hinted that its Coyote truck load brokerage business may be put up for sale. UPS acquired the Chicago-based company for $1.8 billion in 2015.  The Teamsters in September voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with UPS, putting a final seal on contentious labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide. The contract includes pay raises for full- and part-time union workers, the creation of 7,500 full-time jobs and the filling of 22,500 open positions, allowing more part-timers to transition to full-time.  On a conference call Tuesday morning, CEO Carol Tome said that by reducing the company's headcount UPS will realize $1 billion in cost savings. The job eliminations are anticipated to be among management roles and contractors, the company said.  UPS also said Tuesday that its board approved an increase of 1 cent in its quarterly dividend to shareholders of record Feb. 20.

Aimenn Penny, 20, was a member of White Lives Matter, Ohio, a group with racist, pro-Nazi and homophobic views, according to the U.S. Justice Department.  He was arrested last March several days after he threw Molotov cocktails at the Community Church of Chesterland in Chesterland, Ohio.  Penny pleaded guilty in October to a church arson hate crime and to using fire and explosives to commit a felony. He was sentenced to 216 months, or 18 years, in prison by U.S. District Judge Bridget Meehan Brennan, according to a filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  Federal prosecutors said during the case that church burnings have ""a long and sordid history"" in the United States, and such acts serve ""as potent a symbol of hate as burning a cross on a lawn or leaving a hanging noose.""  Drag shows often involve feminine clothing, makeup and hair worn by a man, and have become increasingly mainstream in recent years in the United States. Ohio Republican lawmakers who oppose drag shows consider them contrary to traditional values and have labeled them as explicit and obscene.  U.S. Republicans have led efforts to limit drag in many states recently. Performers and civil rights groups have condemned the proposed drag regulations, saying they are unconstitutional, redundant under existing obscenity laws, and would lead to further harassment and violence against gay and transgender people.

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2024-01-30/panthers-coach-dave-canales-co-wrote-book-about-infidelity-binge-drinking-addiction-to-pornography,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Dave Canales is ready to begin his journey as head coach of the Carolina Panthers 16 months after co-authoring a faith-based book about working through problems with his sexual infidelity, addiction to pornography and binge drinking.  The book “This Marriage? The Question That Changed Everything” was written by Canales and his wife, Lizzy. It details how the 42-year-old coach has worked to overcome his problems and the couple found its way back to a healthy, Christian-based marriage.  Canales wrote that with the help of counseling and family, he no longer has issues with infidelity or pornography and he has stopped drinking completely.  Canales published the book in September 2022 when he was still a position coach with the Seattle Seahawks and before he got his big break and became offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, leaving him one step from becoming a head coach.  The couple said they wrote the book to help other couples struggling with marriage.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “We wanted other people to feel safe starting this journey toward a vibrant marriage by helping them see they are not alone,” the couple wrote in the book’s preface.  The couple said writing the book and reliving the painful details of their past was like going through another round of counseling, but it helped them “find renewed healing and hope through a stronger understanding of what happened.”  The Panthers said they were aware of the book before hiring Canales last week.  A team spokesman said Canales would not be available for comment until his introductory news conference in Charlotte on Thursday.  Canales wrote in the book about how he finally made some “dark confessions” about his infidelity to his wife.  “A huge part in the severed intimacy that I was experiencing with Lizzy was because I was addicted to pornography,” Canales wrote. “It was like a gateway drug for me, creating pathways in my brain that allowed me to use sex coldly for my own benefit. It was a secret, silent struggle that I had years before I was married.”  He also wrote about how he cheated on Lizzy one month before they were married.  “From the start of our relationship, I was binge drinking and going out with friends, without Lizzy,” Canales wrote. ""Before I was ever unfaithful to her, I was already there in my mind. Bad habits combined with addiction made it hard for me to resist temptation. It was a pattern I knew well before we started dating.”  Canales also described himself as a “recovering narcissist,” and detailed how he had to work hard at “developing the skills necessary to be aware beyond myself and my needs.”  As for his issues with drinking, Canales wrote: “I quit drinking alcohol altogether, knowing that I do not have great restraint in that area, and it numbs me to making other poor choices.”  He described how early in his marriage, despite going to church, he would go out at times with friends and take off his wedding ring on certain occasions and act as though he wasn’t married.  Canales said the long hours as an NFL assistant coach weren’t to blame for his issues but gave him more opportunities to make bad decisions.  The couple wrote the book knowing that exposing their painful and highly personal secrets and issues could potentially hinder Canales’ ability to land future jobs in the NFL. They said their marriage now is stronger than ever and their belief in God has helped them, discussing the importance of faith and prayer.  Lizzy Canales wrote in the book that meant essentially burning down the old marriage while bringing forth something entirely new from the ashes.  “Many are shocked when we tell them,” the couple wrote. “For some it is incredibly uncomfortable and maybe even convicting. For others it is like a breath of fresh air and an invitation to go deeper into their own relationships.”  The couple have four children.  In the book’s foreword, former NFL coach Tony Dungy wrote: “Unlike so many couples today, they didn’t let their marriage wither away. They wouldn’t let it go. So instead, David and Lizzy resolved to get things back on the right track and rediscover that sense of purpose and that intimacy they had at the beginning.

The ECB has raised its interest rates by the most in the euro's history in an effort to bring inflation down from double-digits. It was 2.9% at its latest reading and the bank is now widely expected to start cutting borrowing costs in the spring.  Nagel, who had previously described inflation as ""stubborn"" and a ""greedy beast"", struck a more optimistic note on Tuesday.  ""I am now convinced that we have tamed that greedy beast,"" the Bundesbank's president told an event in Berlin.  Still, he stopped far short of backing rate cuts, saying instead that the ECB should decide on any policy changes one meeting at a time and remain focused on incoming data.  Nagel also noted that core inflation remained relatively high and argued that the ECB's current policy stance, which includes a record-high deposit rate of 4.0%, was not very restrictive.

The New York drugmaker also said Tuesday it's reaffirming its forecast for 2024, a month after surprising Wall Street with an initial outlook that missed consensus.  In the fourth quarter, Pfizer said it booked 8% operational revenue growth outside its market-leading COVID vaccine, Comirnaty, and treatment, Paxlovid. That excludes the impact of foreign exchanges.  Comirnaty sales tumbled 53% in the quarter to $5.4 billion, and Pfizer took a $3.1 billion hit from Paxlovid for a revenue reversal. That was tied to the return of unused treatment courses that had been purchased by the government.  The vaccine and treatment helped push Pfizer past $100 billion in sales for 2022. But a big sales drop was expected after the drugmaker switched last year to selling on the commercial market instead relying on bulk government contracts.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company expects to start recovering some of that revenue reversal from Paxlovid this year. Pfizer will contribute to a government stockpile of treatment courses and help establish a patient assistance program.  Overall, Pfizer lost $3.37 billion in the final quarter of 2023 after booking a nearly $5 billion profit in the same quarter the prior year. But earnings adjusted for one-time items came to 10 cents per share.  Analysts had expected a loss of 18 cents per share, according to the data firm FactSet.  Pfizer’s total revenue fell 41% in the quarter to $14.25 billion. That missed the consensus expectation for $14.37 billion.  For the full year, Pfizer earned $2.1 billion on $58.5 billion in total revenue.  The drugmaker says it still expects 2024 adjusted earnings to range between $2.05 and $2.25 per share.  Analysts expect $2.27 per share this year. But Wall Street expectations also are dialed back now from previous consensus forecasts made last fall for earnings per share of $3.17 or more.  Pfizer debuted its 2024 forecast in December. It included sales expectations for its COVID-19 products that fell more than $5 billion short of expectations. The company said then that it was starting conservatively to avoid creating any more uncertainty.  The company had previously scaled back its sales expectations for 2023, which sent Pfizer shares plunging and contributed to a rough year for the stock.

The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a request by the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and the Arkansas State Conference NAACP to reconsider a 2-1 ruling by a panel of judges holding that only the government and not private plaintiffs can pursue cases enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  The panel's November decision marked the first time a federal appeals court had reached such a conclusion. The vast majority of Voting Rights Act lawsuits for decades have been filed by private parties, not the U.S. Department of Justice.  The ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a redistricting plan for the Arkansas State House of Representatives that the two groups alleged undermined the voting power of Black people in the Republican-led state.  The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, have called the November decision ""radical."" It applies to seven states within the 8th Circuit's jurisdiction, Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.  ""That it chose not to rehear the case ignores the gravity of what's at stake — generations of precedent protecting voters and in turn our democracy,"" Sophia Lin Lakin, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued the appeal, said in a statement.  The plaintiffs said they were ""exploring next legal steps."" They could now try to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, where two members of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, have raised the question of whether private litigants do have a right to sue.  In 2022, U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky, an Arkansas federal judge appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump, held that only the U.S. attorney general is empowered to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  That provision prohibits voting rules that are racially discriminatory.  In November's 2-1 opinion authored by U.S. Circuit Judge David Stras, another Trump appointee, the 8th Circuit held that the law does not lay out a ""private right of action,"" even though courts including the Supreme Court have taken on such cases for decades.  Three judges dissented from Thursday's decision to not have the full 8th Circuit rehear the case, including U.S. Circuit Judge Steven Colloton, an appointee of Republican former President George W.

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge ruled Tuesday that state regulators can force factory farms to obtain permits before they discharge pollutants, ensuring protections continue to apply preemptively for lakes, streams and drinking water.  Calumet County Circuit Judge Carey Reed issued the decision from the bench in a lawsuit brought by factory farm lobbyists, finding the state Department of Natural Resources has clear legal authority to protect the state's waters.  “This ruling is critical because it preserves the DNR’s ability to address water pollution that can be caused by these facilities, at a time when many surface and groundwaters around the state are contaminated with animal waste,"" said Evan Feinauer, an attorney with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin. ""Allowing large dairies to sidestep oversight would have been catastrophic for water protection in our state.”  Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, filed a lawsuit in Calumet County in May on behalf of the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Venture Dairy Cooperative, two groups that lobby for factory farms.  The groups challenged the DNR's authority to impose mandates through factory farms' water pollution permits such as monitoring groundwater pollution levels, implementing manure management plans and limiting herd sizes. Last year the agency scaled back S&S Jerseyland Dairy’s request to expand from roughly 5,000 cows to 10,000 cows, allowing the operation to add only about 2,400 animals.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The plaintiffs alleged that federal courts in 2005 and 2011 struck down the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to require factory farms obtain permits before they actually discharge contaminants into navigable waters. Therefore, the groups argued, the DNR’s requirement that factory farms obtain permits before the fact was also invalid because it now conflicted with federal law.  The groups' interpretation would have allowed factory farms greater freedom to increase herd sizes and contaminate state waters with chemicals such as nitrates and phosphates from manure and other fertilizers.  Reed sided with the DNR, pointing to a section of state law that declares Wisconsin policy calls for restoring and maintaining the integrity of its waters to protect public health and aquatic wildlife.  WMC spokesperson Nick Novak declined to comment on the ruling.  The farming industry and environmentalists have been locked in a fierce back-and-forth over regulating factory farms, defined as farms with at least 1,000 beef cattle, 715 dairy cows or 200,000 chickens. According to the state Department of Natural Resources, more than 330 such farms are currently permitted to operate in Wisconsin.  Conservationists say factory farms produce massive amounts of manure that contaminate groundwater, streams and creeks. Industry advocates counter that regulations are too strict and stifle growth.  Clean Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Farmers Union, a group that lobbies for sustainable farming, joined the case as intervenors. Environmental law firm Midwest Environmental Advocates represented that group in the proceedings.  “We are pleased that the circuit court upheld longstanding clean water protections and rejected this reckless lawsuit,” Midwest Environmental Advocates staff attorney Adam Voskuil said in a statement. “The claims advanced by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and their clients would have exposed rural Wisconsinites and small family farmers to illegal manure discharges, polluting their drinking water and Wisconsin's rivers and lakes.""",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Wisconsin Judge Affirms Regulators Can Force Factory Farms to Get Preemptive Pollution Permits,4 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
3,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/why-the-rise-in-breast-cancers-in-younger-women,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A surge in breast cancers for women younger than 50 has puzzled medical experts, but a new study provides some new information that could help halt this trend.  The steady increase in diagnoses during the past two decades has largely been driven by breast cancers fueled by the female hormone estrogen, formally known as estrogen-receptor positive tumors, researchers report Jan. 26 in the journal JAMA Network Open.  In addition, some decreases have occurred in specific tumor types and among specific groups of women -- observations that could offer clues to possible prevention strategies.  “This research offers a way to begin identifying the factors driving these increasing rates, with the goal of finding ways to slow or reverse them,” said senior study author Dr. Adetunji Toriola, a professor of surgery with the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.  “It also could help identify young women who are at high risk of developing early-onset breast cancer, so that we can design interventions to evaluate in clinical trials to see if we can lower that risk,” Toriola added in a university news release.  For the study, researchers analyzed data on more than 217,000 U.S. women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2019.  In 2000, the breast cancer rate among women ages 20 to 49 was about 64 cases of breast cancer for every 100,000 people, researchers said.  During the next 16 years, that rate increased at a slow trudge of about 0.24% per year, reaching 66 cases per 100,000 by 2016, the data show.  But after 2016, the breast cancer trend line took a steep uphill turn, increasing at 3.76% per year.  Only three years later, in 2019, the breast cancer rate among young women had reached 74 cases per 100,000 women.  “For most women, regular breast cancer screening does not begin until at least age 40, so younger women diagnosed with breast cancer tend to have later-stage tumors, when the disease is more advanced and more difficult to treat,” Toriola noted.  Researchers found that estrogen-receptor positive tumors made up nearly the entire increase in breast cancer cases.  In fact, breast cancers that didn’t involve the estrogen receptor actually declined during the two decades of study.  “We need to understand what is driving the specific increase in estrogen-receptor positive tumors,” Toriola said. “We also hope to learn from the decrease in estrogen-receptor negative tumors. If we can understand what is driving that rate down, perhaps we can apply it in efforts to reduce or prevent other breast tumor types.”  Black women had higher rates of breast cancer, especially those ages 20 to 29, results show.  Black females in that age group had a 53% increased risk of breast cancer, compared to white women the same age, researchers said.  Black women ages 30 to 39 also have a higher risk, but it’s just 15% greater compared to white women in the same age range, researchers said.  Then from ages 40 to 49, the rate for Black women actually dropped below that of white women, results show.  Hispanic women had the lowest rate of breast cancer of any group, researchers noted.  Toriola said the research team is evaluating breast tumor tissue from cancer patients of different ages and races to try and figure out why young Black women are at increased risk.  In other results, researchers found an increase in cancers diagnosed at stage 1 and stage 4, and a decrease in diagnoses at stages 2 and 3.  This suggests that improvements in breast cancer screening and better awareness of genetic cancer risks have led to many tumors being caught early, Toriola said.  However, it also suggests that when early-stage tumors are missed in younger women, they don’t tend to be detected until they’ve become advanced, he said.  When a woman was born also played a role in breast cancer risk, researchers added.  There was a greater than 20% increased risk of breast cancer among women born in 1990, compared to those born in 1955, results show.  “We are hopeful this study will offer clues to prevention strategies that will be effective in younger women, especially younger Black women, who are at particularly high risk of developing breast cancer before age 40,” Toriola said.

But the bloodsucking “vampire” was no “drivers license,"" the song that kickstarted her career. Instead of descending into her loss in the song, Rodrigo stands atop of her anger, reclaiming her agency in the process. The production mirrors this progress: it is a triumphant revenge anthem, textured, theatrical, an explosive introduction to what would become her second full-length album, 2023's “GUTS.”  And just like the first, it is a showstopper. This year, Rodrigo is nominated for six Grammys. The single “vampire” is up for record and song of the year, as well as best pop solo performance. “GUTS” could take home album of the year or maybe best pop vocal album, and finally, her track “ballad of a homeschooled girl” is up for best rock song.  “I love the Grammys so much!” Rodrigo told The Associated Press at the film academy's Governors Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month. “I grew up watching them. My mom and I used to, like, make predictions of who we thought was going to win every year.  And so just to be able to attend as a fan is incredible. And the fact that I’m nominated is just, you know, absolutely incredible, just unfathomable.""  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  But in many ways, it is fathomable: Rodrigo won best new artist, best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance at the 2022 Grammy Awards for her debut album, “SOUR,” and of course, for her 2021 smash “drivers license.”  On “GUTS,"" one the Associated Press' picks for best albums of 2023, Rodrigo performs 12 tracks of big feelings balladry and riot grrrl-informed power pop-punk, the perfect soundtrack for a person entering their 20s — or for those of us who remember the frustrations of the age. It's a maturation from the somber teenage dreams of “SOUR."" On “GUTS,"" as AP's review of the album concludes, Rodrigo recognizes that there are few forces are more potent than a young creative woman’s dissatisfaction — in some ways, more productive than heartbreak.  “I love singing about rage,” Rodrigo says. “I think I’m a very happy kind of, you know, generally excited person. And I think that in my music and my songwriting, I can kind of express parts of myself that are not so easy to talk about in everyday life, and so rage definitely applies to that.""  She continued, ""I love just having a song where I can kind of scream and get all of my emotions out. I think it’s so therapeutic.”  Performing anger is certainly valuable for a kind of catharsis — and it is the fuel that ignites Rodrigo's lyrical fires, like in the deliciously ironic “I got class and integrity like a g——— Kennedy, I swear” from “GUTS” opener “all-american bitch."" For that very reason, Rodrigo has read up to sharpen her craft.  In addition to a Joan Didion reference in that song — as well as taking a poetry class at the University of Southern California — “GUTS” is informed by an increased interest in songwriting development.  “I think I read a lot more this year, and that definitely informed the writing process of 'GUTS,'"" she says.  As for songwriting? “I love Leonard Cohen,"" she says of her literary and musical influences. ""And Leonard Cohen’s poetry.

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-01-30/imf-sketches-a-brighter-view-of-global-economy-upgrading-growth-forecast-and-seeing-lower-inflation,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its outlook for the world economy this year, envisioning resilient growth led by the United States and a slower pace of inflation.  In its latest outlook, the 190-country lending agency said Tuesday that it now expects the global economy to grow 3.1% this year, unchanged from 2023 but better than the 2.9% it had predicted for 2024 in its previous estimate in October.  Worldwide, the IMF thinks inflation will ease from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. In the most advanced economies, the agency expects inflation to drop this year to 2.6% and next year to the 2% level that the Federal Reserve and some other central banks have set as a target.  The combination of steady growth and falling inflation has raised hopes for a so-called soft landing for the global economy – a slowdown sufficient to contain inflation without causing a recession.  “We are now in the final descent toward a soft landing,’’ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters ahead of the report’s release.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The forecast for overall global growth this year and next (3.2%) trails the 3.8% average from 2000 to 2019. That is partly because the Fed and other central banks aggressively raised interest rates to fight high inflation, and the resulting higher borrowing costs have slowed spending and investment.  Gourinchas said he expects “relatively limited’’ economic damage from the attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea. The attacks have forced container ships carrying cargo between Asia and Europe to avoid the Suez Canal and instead take the long way around the tip of Africa, thereby delaying and disrupting shipments and raising freight charges. But Gourinchas said that for now, the Red Sea disruptions don't seem to be “a major source of reigniting supply side inflation,” which arose from far more severe shipping backlogs in 2021 and 2022.  For the United States, the world's largest economy, the IMF sharply marked up its estimate for growth this year – to 2.1% from the 1.5% it had penciled in three months ago. The U.S. economy expanded 2.5% in 2023 after an unexpected burst of year-end growth fueled by consumers willing to spend despite higher borrowing costs.  The outlook for the slumping Chinese economy was also upgraded by the IMF. It now expects the world’s second-biggest economy to grow 4.6% this year, up from the 4.2% it had forecast in October but down from 5.2% growth in 2023. Government spending has helped offset the damage from a collapse in the Chinese housing market.  “There was a lot of resilience in many, many parts of the world,’’ Gourinchas said, singling out Brazil, India, Southeast Asia and Russia, which has remained surprisingly sturdy in the face of Western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine.  But the IMF downgraded the outlook for some places. Europe, for example, continues to struggle with dispirited consumers and the lingering effects of the energy price shock caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The IMF expects the 20 countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow a meager 0.9% this year. That would be up from 0.5% growth in 2023 but down from the IMF’s October forecast of 1.2% growth for the eurozone this year.  The IMF also modestly downgraded the outlook for the Japanese economy, to 0.9%, a drop from 1.9% growth in 2023.  The improving inflation outlook is a result of higher interest rates, the end of the supply chain backlogs of the past couple of years, more workers entering the job market and lower energy prices after the spike caused by the Ukraine war. The IMF expects oil prices, which plunged 16% in 2023, to fall a further 2.3% this year and 4.8% in 2025.  The world economy still faces risks. One is that financial markets have become too confident that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates as early as its meeting in March. Gourinchas said he doesn’t expect the rate-cutting to start until the second half of 2024. Disappointed investors could drive down stock prices if they don’t see lower rates as soon as they hoped.  Another is that geopolitical tensions, especially between the United States and China, could disrupt world trade. Gourinchas suggested that some of President Joe Biden’s economic policies, including those that benefit American producers of computer chips and green technology, could violate World Trade Organization rules.  The IMF expects world trade to grow just 3.3% this year and 3.6% in 2025, below the historical average of 4.9%.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","IMF Sketches a Brighter View of Global Economy, Upgrading Growth Forecast and Seeing Lower Inflation",10 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

That saved $7.2 million in hospital expenses, researchers estimated -- a drop from $7.6 million in 2006 to just under $386,000 in 2020.  “Emergency departments are important sites for accessing emergency contraception given their 24-hour access and high acuity care,” said senior researcher Dr. Erica Marsh, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Michigan Health Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital.  For the study, researchers analyzed national data of more than 2 million ER visits among women ages 15 to 44 during the 14-year period.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first product for emergency contraception in 1998, with over-the-counter approval following for adults in 2006 and minors in 2013. Coverage by insurance is mandated by the Affordable Care Act.  Women who go to the ER for emergency contraception tend to be younger, low-income, Medicaid-insured and Black or Hispanic, researchers discovered.  “We found an overrepresentation of certain demographic groups utilizing emergency departments for emergency contraception,” Marsh said in a university news release. “This aligns with previous outpatient research suggesting ongoing barriers to over-the-counter emergency contraception access and or increased emergency department utilization for other reasons, including sexual assault.”  Northeast hospitals saw the most visits for emergency contraception, accounting for 44% to 59% of the national total despite having just 17% to 19% of overall ER visits.  Meanwhile, southern hospitals saw just 4.5% to 17% of visits related to emergency contraception, despite consistently averaging more than 40% of other types of ER visits, researchers found.  “Our analysis suggests ongoing barriers in over-the-counter emergency contraception and disparities in utilization for certain populations,” Marsh said. “Future policies should reduce barriers to make emergency contraception safe and affordable to all.”  More information  Planned Parenthood has more about emergency contraception.

María Ángela Holguín Cuellar, the U.N. chief’s new personal envoy for Cyprus, said she believes she can work with both Greek Cypriots in the island’s internationally recognized south and Turkish Cypriots in the breakaway north to get them back to the negotiating table after years of complete stalemate.  “I was part of that team that we finally reached a peace agreement” in Colombia, Holguín told reporters after her first meeting with the Greek Cypriot President of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides. “And I think I can collaborate and do all my best for ... a good result for Cyprus.”  Holguín served as Colombia’s top diplomat during 2010-2018 and as its representative to the U.N. during 2004-2006. It’s her first trip to the east Mediterranean island nation after her appointment earlier this month.  She is also meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar later on Tuesday. Separately, she will contact women’s organizations and other civil society groups over the next few days for a first-hand assessment to gauge the conditions for a resumption of full-fledged peace talks.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Cyprus was divided along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup mounted by Greek junta-backed supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a 1983 Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence and maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island’s northern third.  A Cyprus peace deal would reduce a source of potential conflict next door to an unstable Middle East and allow for the easier harnessing of hydrocarbon reserves in the eastern Mediterranean Sea’s natural gas-rich waters.  But Holguín faces a tough task. The two sides have grown further apart in the years since the last major push to reach a peace settlement in the summer of 2017. The fact that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has dispatched an envoy to tell him if it’s worth another U.N.–facilitated round of negotiations indicates the degree of caution with which the world body is approaching the conflict after half a century of failure.  Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots say the only way to peace is a two-state deal, ditching an agreement to reunify the island as a federation composed of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones. Speaking after his meeting with Holguín Tuesday, Tatar repeated he won't engage in formal negotiations unless Turkish Cypriot sovereignty is recognized as equal to that of the Cyprus Republic.  The majority Greek Cypriots reject anything that would formalize a partition, as well as demands for a Turkish Cypriot veto on all federal-level government decisions, a permanent Turkish troop presence and Turkish military intervention rights.  Cyprus government spokesman Constantinos Letymbiotis dismissed Tatar’s remark that Holguín’s time to reach any assessment is limited to a few months.  “There’s no timetable, there no time limit,"" he said. ""Certainly, we believe that if there’s the same political will from the other side, the resumption of talks can happen very quickly.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",A UN Envoy Says Her Experience in Colombia Deal May Help Her Efforts in Restarting Cyprus Talks,7 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

In a Monday post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Musk said that the patient received the implant the day prior and was “recovering well.” He added that “initial results show promising neuron spike detection.”  The billionaire, who co-founded Neuralink, did not provide additional details about the patient. When Neuralink announced in September that it would begin recruiting people, the company said it was searching for individuals with quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease.  Neuralink is one of many groups working on linking the nervous system to computers, efforts aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other applications. There are more than 40 brain computer interface trials underway, according to clinicaltrials.gov.  Neuralink reposted Musk's Monday post on X, but did not publish any additional statements acknowledging the human implant. The company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Tuesday.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Neuralink previously announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved its “investigational device exemption,” which generally allows a sponsor to begin a clinical study “in patients who fit the inclusion criteria,” the FDA said Tuesday. The agency pointed out that it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.  Neuralink’s device is about the size of a large coin and is designed to be implanted in the skull, with ultra-thin wires going directly into the brain. In its September announcement, Neuralink said the wires would be surgically placed in a region of the brain that controls movement intention. The initial goal of the so-called brain computer interface is to give people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.  In a separate Monday post on X, Musk said that the first Neuralink product is called “Telepathy” — which, he said, will enable users to control their phones or computers “just by thinking.” He added that intial users would be those who have lost use of their limbs.  It’s unclear how well this device or similar interfaces will ultimately work, or how safe they might be. Clinical trials are designed to collect data on safety and effectiveness.  Laura Cabrera, who researches brain science at Pennsylvania State University, said that even though Neuralink uses an innovative procedure – robotic surgery – to get the device in the brain, no one has implanted it before in humans and much remains unknown.  Brain surgery is “not a trivial thing,” she said, pointing to significant potential risks such as brain hemorrhage or seizures. “And so I think we have to be mindful that even though they’re using a novel way to implant the device, we just don’t know if it’s truly going to be a … safer approach for human patients.”  She pointed out that Neuralink’s competitors plan to use their devices for medical applications only, but Musk has been outspoken about going beyond medicine. For example, Cabrera said, Musk has talked about implants for the masses that will allow people to record everything that happens to them and access the information when they want — which may raise red flags for some.  “We know that he has very bold claims,” she said. “People not really assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the technology is something that I worry about.”  ___  Ungar reported from Columbia, Missouri.

Biden, a Democrat who is seeking another four-year term in the Nov. 5 election, is stopping at fundraising events in Jupiter, near Palm Beach, and in Miami.  Trump, heavily favored to win the Republican nomination for president, has made the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach his home since leaving the White House in January 2021.  Travelers with the president on Air Force One could see Trump's private jet on the same tarmac when they landed in Florida, and Biden's fundraiser took place miles away from a Trump golf course.  Biden's campaign so far has shown little interest in making a major play to win Florida in 2024 despite the state's longtime former status as a competitive region for Democrats and Republicans.  In 2020, Trump beat Biden 51.2%-47.9% in Florida, improving on Republicans' margin of victory there four years earlier despite millions of dollars spent by Biden-aligned Democrats.  Still, the Biden campaign has been eager to tap into the financial resources afforded by the state's well-to-do residents, and Biden expressed optimism during his first fundraiser that Florida could swing his way.  ""I think we can win Florida,"" he said.  Floridians were the fourth-largest source of donations to Biden's 2020 campaign and the third-largest source for Trump's that year, according to Federal Election Commission data.  Biden and the Democratic Party raised $97 million during the last three months of 2023. Trump raised $45 million in the third quarter, the latest figures available, and not including Republican Party fundraising.  Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Biden's fundraising. The Biden campaign declined to comment.  In Jupiter, Biden said Trump and his supporters were dividing the country and reiterated his argument that democracy is at stake in the 2024 election.  “The American consumer is feeling real confidence in the economy that we’re building ... Let me tell you who else is noticing this: Donald Trump,” Biden said.  U.S. consumer confidence increased to a two-year high in January amid slowing inflation and expectations that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates soon.  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, the lone remaining challenger to Trump for the nomination, was scheduled to be in South Florida for fundraisers on Wednesday and then return to the campaign trail in South Carolina on Thursday, according to a senior campaign official.  Hosts for Biden's Miami fundraiser include Biden Victory Fund national finance chair Chris Korge. The Palm Beach hosts include lawyer Sean Domnick, according to information obtained by Reuters.

2,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/explainer-the-case-against-elon-musks-56-billion-pay-package,"By Jody Godoy and Tom Hals  (Reuters) - A Delaware judge on Tuesday invalidated Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package for his work as Tesla's chief executive, siding with a Tesla shareholder who called the package unfair.  Musk is one of the world's wealthiest people, according to Forbes Magazine, and his 2018 compensation package for leading the electric-vehicle maker much larger than any executive pay package to date.  Here is what the case is about:  WHO SUED AND WHY?  An investor named Richard Tornetta sued Musk and several Tesla directors in 2018, claiming Musk's pay package was unfair. While Tornetta held just nine Tesla shares, the deal had also been criticized by major pension fund California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and proxy advisory firms, who viewed the deal as too large.  Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package.  Tesla achieved the financial goals, helping make Musk one of the world's wealthiest people.  Tornetta claimed the pay was not necessary to incentivize Musk to achieve success for Tesla, as Musk already owned around 22% of the automaker's stock.  WHAT WAS MUSK'S DEFENSE?  Tesla's board argued in court filings that the pay package was needed to align Musk's incentives with shareholders and to keep him focused on the company as it ramped up production of the Model 3. It argued that Musk did not receive any compensation other than the stock options and that if Tesla had not achieved the targets in the pay package, Musk would not have received any money.  Shareholders were told that the goals tied to Musk's pay were ""challenging"" yet ""attainable.""  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  Musk is likely to appeal, experts said. Before that can happen, the judge will have to finalize the ruling and decide on compensation for the lawyers who represented Tornetta on a contingency basis.  Even without the pay package, Musk benefited from his 22% ownership share of Tesla's stock at the time the package was adopted in 2018. Since then, Tesla's stock has risen about 10-fold, raising the value of his stake by more than $100 billion.  CAN TESLA PAY MUSK RETROACTIVELY?  Musk said in January that discussions on a new pay package with the board were on holding pending the outcome of the case over the 2018 package.  The plaintiff's legal team has said in court documents that the board could adopt a new plan to pay Musk for his work for the last five years, saying that this plan would have to be reasonable.  Experts said any such payment would likely pale in comparison with the stock grant and could lead to more legal headaches.  Jesse Fried, an executive pay expert and professor at Harvard Law School, said that while Delaware courts sometimes allow boards to make modest ""gift"" payments to executives for past performance, shareholders could easily sue over such a payment to Musk, claiming it was a waste of corporate resources.  ""Musk has already generated value for the shareholders. If they were to write a check to him now for $10 billion for past performance, what exactly do the shareholders get from that?"" he said.

3,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-01-30/ozone-linked-deaths-on-the-rise-globally,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter  HealthDay  TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Deaths related to ozone air pollution will rise significantly around the world during the next two decades due to climate change, a new study warns.  Cities in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa can expect to see ozone-related deaths increase by as many as 6,200 fatalities a year by 2054 unless humans rein in global warming, researchers project.  “This paper is further evidence of the health benefits that can be achieved if more countries adhered to the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals,” said senior researcher Kai Chen, an assistant professor of public health at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Conn.  In the study, researchers analyzed short-term exposure to ground-level ozone pollution and daily deaths in 406 cities across 20 countries and regions. They used four specific climate change scenarios to predict future death rates due to air pollution.  Ozone is the primary component of smog, and it has been linked to respiratory problems, heart disease and premature death, researchers said in background notes.  Ozone forms when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants and industry chemically react in the presence of sunlight. Ozone is most likely to reach unhealthy levels on hot, sunny days in cities, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Researchers estimated that ozone-related deaths will claim as many as 6,200 lives a year in those cities by 2050-2054, up from an average 45 deaths annually in 2010-2014.  However, they also found that strong climate and air quality controls could make a difference.  In the scenario where nations stuck to the Paris climate accords, ozone-related deaths only increased by a projected 0.7% between 2010 and 2054, researcher said.  On the other hand, weak climate or air pollution controls led to an increase in ozone-related deaths of 56% to 94%.  All scenarios except compliance with the Paris accords led to an increase in mortality fractions -- the number of ozone-related excess deaths divided by total deaths.  “In all four of the climate scenarios we studied, only the scenario that aligns with the Paris Agreement would see a reduction in ozone-related mortality fraction in the future,” Chen said.  The new study was published Jan. 23 in the journal One Earth.  The researchers noted that many countries’ climate and air quality standards fall short of what is needed to stem this tide.  In the most optimistic scenario for human health, researchers set the threshold for maximum allowable exposure at 70 micrograms of ozone per cubic meter of air.  By contrast, the World Health Organization’s current air quality standard is 100 micrograms, researchers said. The standard is 137 in the United States and Mexico, 160 in China, and 120 in Europe.  “Our study highlights the need for more rigorous ozone standards,” the scientists concluded in a Yale news release. “Beyond mitigating ozone-related acute excess mortality, the implementation of stricter air quality regulations will likely yield additional benefits in terms of reducing long-term ozone-related mortality and conferring climate benefits.”  More information  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has more about ozone pollution.

Secretary General Antonio Guterres started contacts on divided Cyprus on Tuesday, seeking to break years of stalemate in peace talks.  U.N. envoy Maria Angela Holguin, a former Colombian foreign minister, was on her first visit after being appointed envoy on Jan. 5 with a mandate to explore the resumption of negotiations.  ""I come from a country that lived through 50 years of conflict ... I think I can collaborate and do all my best for a good result for Cyprus,"" she told reporters, referring to civil war in Colombia which struck peace in 2016 with the main rebels.  Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup and remains a source of friction between fellow NATO military alliance members Greece and Turkey.  Countless mediation attempts have failed. The last round of U.N.-sponsored negotiations collapsed in disarray in 2017 over the role of Turkey in a post-settlement Cyprus.  Holguin, who was Colombian foreign minister from 2010 to 2018, met with President Nikos Christodoulides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar.  ""We reiterated our focus to approach this new phase ... with sincere political will and positive input to create preconditions for the resumption of talks,"" a spokesperson for Christodoulides said.  His administration last week unveiled a series of confidence building measures directed at Turkish Cypriots.  Tatar, who has headed a breakaway state in north Cyprus since 2020, wants a two-state settlement.  That is rejected by Greek Cypriots, who cite previously-agreed accords and U.N. resolutions that the island reunite under a federal umbrella with a strong central government.  ""All the efforts during years of talks to find a solution in a federation basis have yielded no result since the other side does not want to share prosperity and governance with the Turkish side equitably,"" Tatar said after meeting Holguin.  ""For there to be a fair, sustainable and lasting agreement in Cyprus, the sovereignty of the Turkish Cypriots must absolutely be recognised ... It is not possible for us to take a step back from this.""  At present Cyprus's internationally-recognised government is comprised solely of Greek Cypriots, a legacy of a constitutional breakdown in 1963 when a power-sharing administration with Turkish Cypriots crumbled amid violence.

5,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-01-30/order-to-liquidate-property-giant-china-evergrande-is-just-one-step-in-fixing-chinas-debt-crisis,"BANGKOK (AP) — A Hong Kong court’s order to liquidate China Evergrande, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, is only a tentative step toward resolving a debt crisis that is haunting financial markets and dragging on the Chinese economy.  Evergrande owes $340 billion to its creditors. Experts say it’s unclear if Monday's order will be enforced in mainland China, where the company and 90% of its assets are based. Lenders inside of China already have claims on most of those “onshore” assets, and Beijing is likely to favor them.  The order by the Hong Kong High Court also is not a remedy for the crisis of confidence haunting China’s financial markets.  The liquidators acting on behalf of the creditors in the Hong Kong case “will have a relatively straightforward path to trying to claim offshore assets,"" Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, said. “But the company has very few offshore assets. Almost everything is onshore, and onshore the liquidators’ authority simply isn’t recognized.”  Officials have made it clear their priority is to satisfy claims on prepaid housing that developers haven't delivered, Silver said. “And even after that would be the onshore creditors. So once you get to that stage, there’s nothing left that would flow to the offshore creditors,” he said.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Such worries appeared to resurface a day after the court's liquidation order, which followed Evergrande's failure to reach an agreement with its creditors. Markets in both Hong Kong and Shanghai fell Tuesday while share prices of property developers sank.  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng dropped 2.3%, and the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.8%. Country Garden, one of the biggest property companies to have defaulted on its debts, dropped 5.7%. Sunac China Holdings plunged 7.1% and Guangzhou R&F Properties gave up 4.6%.  In the past year, the Hang Seng has lost almost 30% of its value. The Shanghai Composite has fallen more than 13%.  Ripple effects from the property crisis, coupled with lingering damage from the coronavirus pandemic, have plagued China's economic recovery and are expected to take growth below 5% this year.  While Evergrande’s cash crunch represented a big chunk of the liabilities developers defaulted on, China's financial woes are not confined to the property sector. Many Chinese financial institutions and local governments also are in a pickle.  Overall, outstanding property debt was estimated at 60 trillion yuan ($8.9 trillion), or nearly 50% of China's GDP in 2022, Swiss Re Institute, a private research company, said in a recent report.  So far, such risks have only rattled financial markets without causing huge upheavals. State-owned Chinese banks and other domestic entities own most of the debt owed by Chinese property developers. Some developers already have worked out arrangements with their creditors, both in and outside China, bringing overall property debt to 30% of GDP by last year, the Swiss Re report said.  David Goodman, director of the University of Sydney’s China Studies Center, said he thinks China’s property debt burdens are unlikely to precipitate a major financial crisis. “The fact of the matter is that the Chinese financial system is not as open or as marketized (as in the United States),” he said.  Mortgage foreclosures are less of a risk in China than in the U.S. Although foreclosures have risen, Chinese home buyers generally must make down payments that cover most of the costs of their purchases.  Property sales fell nearly 20% in 2023 from a year earlier, while house prices dropped 6%.  The government has gradually rolled out measures to relieve pressure on the real estate market, freeing up more money for financing while limiting use of such loans for new property investments. It also ordered banks to better manage the risks that led to a 2020 crackdown on excessive borrowing that helped bring on the crisis.  The latest policy initiatives were expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in funding — only a small fraction of the total owed — to help developers cover their operating costs and pay down debt.  The question is whether banks will choose to lend to developers and how property companies will balance debt payments with the need to finish the projects they have underway.  The backlog of unfinished apartments is estimated at about 20 million units. At least another 65 million units are reportedly unoccupied. Meanwhile, the government has boosted spending on affordable housing and urban renewal.  While China's banks are generally in good shape, with ample reserves and low levels of loans gone sour, the wider financial system is in a more precarious state.  Local governments, with an estimated 100 trillion yuan ($13.8 trillion) in total debt, have lost a key source of revenue with the downturn in sales of land-use rights — one of the biggest risks within the system.

Hours earlier, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global reported the largest annual return in its history, a performance led by U.S. technology companies and Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which makes the diabetes-turned-weight loss drug Ozempic.  The fund, which invests Norway’s profits from oil and gas, owns around 1.5% of all shares for companies listed globally, including large stakes in Exxon Mobil, Chevron, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP. It has used the assets to lobby for a speedier transition to sustainable energy and voting for more carbon reduction targets.  “It is a balancing act between sustainability and profitability. We are trying to push them to be prepared for the eventual and inescapable transition,” Nicolai Tangen, the manager of the portfolio also known as the Oil Fund, told The Associated Press.  Tangen reported that despite “high inflation and geopolitical turmoil,” the fund’s value ballooned 16% last year to 15,765 billion kroner (around $ 1,500 billion). That corresponds to $273,000 for every inhabitant of Norway, which has a population of 5.5 million.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  He said the fund also benefited in 2023 from market excitement over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence technology such as ChatGPT, while also revealing that managers used AI to “optimize deployment of capital” in its own investments.  However, Tanger said the decision he was most proud of was swooping in to take a large stake in Swiss bank UBS the day after its emergency buyout of former rival Credit Suisse.  “We thought it was a really exciting opportunity. The share price recovered and we think there is big scope for more value,” he told the AP.  The six largest contributors to the fund’s growth were the U.S technology companies Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet. Electric car maker Tesla came in seventh.  Tangen said the fund nonetheless would continue to fight “excessive” executive pay in American boardrooms. The fund voted against more than 50% of all pay deals worth more than $20 million.  Denmark-based Novo Nordisk was the next highest contributor. Ozempic was originally developed as a diabetes treatment, but its growth accelerated in 2023 as more people sought it out as an obesity treatment. Nova Nordisk also makes a higher dose version of the same medication that is sold as a weight loss drug under the brand name Wegovy.  The majority of the fund is made up of shares, but it also includes government bonds, real estate and renewable energy infrastructure.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","After a Record Year, Norway's Giant Oil Fund Pledges to Push Sustainable Energy",12 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

The company aims to roll out the machines for production of memory chips before expanding to other areas, Asada said.  Canon expects to sell 247 of its existing lithography machines in the financial year ending December compared to 187 units a year earlier, boosted by demand for power chips and graphics processing units (GPU) for artificial intelligence tasks.

The progressive rock band Bi-2 said on Facebook that it had information that intervention from Russian diplomats caused the plan to be scuttled, even though tickets had already been purchased for their flight.  “The group participants remain detained at the immigration center in a shared cell with 80 people,” the post said. It said they declined to meet with the Russian consul. The Russian press agency RIA Novosti said the refusal was confirmed by Ilya Ilyin, head of the Russian Embassy's consular section.  The group later said on the Telegram messaging app that its singer, Yegor Bortnik, whose stage name is Lyova, boarded a flight for Israel late Tuesday, but the other members remained in the jail.

Marsalis was named Tuesday as the new artistic director for the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, a donor-supported education and community center and the cornerstone of the Musicians' Village, a Habitat for Humanity housing development that benefited displaced musicians after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005.  The center is named for Branford's late father, a pianist, teacher and patriarch of an accomplished family of New Orleans musicians that also includes Branford's brother, trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis. The elder Marsalis served as the artistic director when the center opened in 2012 until his death in April 2020.  “I didn’t move back to do this. I moved back to move back,” Marsalis, who has lived for years in Durham, North Carolina, said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the formal announcement. “This is the icing on the cake.”  Marsalis, who later Tuesday performed with some of the students enrolled at the center, said he'll be carrying on a legacy of music education in the tradition of his father.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “Most of them are probably not even going to be musicians,” he said of the young people who attend programs at the center. “But I think that much like most high school kids playing football are not going to become professionals, we're going to use the discipline of music and the philosophy of hearing and all these things to help them ascend in whatever, they decide they want to do, to do in the future. And, I mean, both of my parents were kind of like that.”  The center provides music and cultural education programs — and not just for young people.  “One of the funny things that started with the center — these kids were coming home, and then the parents came up and said, ‘Well, what about us? Can we get some lessons too?"" said Marsalis.  He was sitting in the control room of the center's recording studio, where musicians who live in the Musician’s Village can record for small fees. “So, we have a lot of musicians who are making records here, recording here, doing concerts here,” Marsalis said.  Branford Marsalis and fellow New Orleans musician Harry Connick Jr. spearheaded the development of the village to provide housing for New Orleans musicians who lost their homes after levee failures during Katrina led to catastrophic flooding.  Connick, Marsalis said, wanted to do more than just help musicians attain home ownership.  “Harry said, ‘You know, I’ve always wanted to start this school.’ And I said, 'A school's impractical.' And then it just very quickly became — Harry brought up the idea to our manager, Ann Marie Wilkins — and it became, a community center where music was kind of used as the driving force, but not the main force. We were going to use music the way that a lot of these community centers use basketball in sports.”  As the project developed, so did the idea of naming the center for Ellis Marsalis, who took an immediate interest in the center. “He had all these ideas,” Branford Marsalis said. “And he communicated a lot of those ideas to Ann Marie — for hours.”  Marsalis said he is proud to step into his father's shoes at the center. He described his role as part of a tradition of New Orleans musicians continuing the city's musical legacy. “We're doing what we're supposed to be doing,” he said.  And that is a legacy, he said, that even the Katrina disaster could not have ended.  “No, we’re talking about 120 years of musicians who have done this for each other. Katrina was just a bump in the road,” Marsalis said. “Really. I mean, there was never any question in my mind that the city would rebuild and that the musicians would come back because, quite frankly, they can’t be anywhere else.”  ___ An earlier version of this report gave an incorrect year for when Ellis Marsalis died.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Homecoming: Branford Marsalis New Artistic Director at New Orleans Music Center Named for His Father,9 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

The second part, to be delivered in person to state lawmakers Tuesday evening, was to focus on public safety, violence and extreme weather events.  She was delivering her annual address just weeks after powerful storms ravaged coastal communities and three months after an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston.

However, this year is, and must be, different,” she wrote. “If we do not budget responsibly now, the Legislature will be forced to make painful cuts in the future — just like other states are having to do now.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  To that end, she said she proposed setting aside $100 million for the next two-year budget as state income is anticipated to level off after several years of higher-than-expected growth.

The Library of Congress said Tuesday that songwriter-performer John and lyricist Taupin will receive the library's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, called by the institution “one of the great songwriting duos of all time.”  They will be bestowed the prize at an all-star tribute concert in Washington, D.C., on March 20. PBS will air portions of it on April 8.  “Elton John and Bernie Taupin have written some of the most memorable songs of our lives. Their careers stand out for the quality and broad appeal of their music and their influence on their fellow artists,” Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in a statement.  Their hits include “Your Song,” “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man” “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” “Bennie and The Jets” and “Crocodile Rock.” John has retired from touring.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The prize, named after Jazz Age songwriters George and Ira Gershwin, is described as the “nation’s highest award for influence, impact and achievement in popular music.”  Taupin was in many ways the Ira to John’s George Gershwin, a lyricist who liked to tell stories with his words, whether giving “a mohair suit, electric boots” to “Bennie and the Jets” or calling Marilyn Monroe — and later Princess Diana — “A Candle in the Wind.” John was the showman, pounding his piano and famous for impressive melodic hooks and elaborate costumes.  Past recipients include Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Willie Nelson, Smokey Robinson, Tony Bennett,Lionel Richie,Joni Mitchell, Emilio and Gloria Estefan and Garth Brooks.  “I’ve been writing songs with Bernie for 56 years, and we never thought that that one day this might be bestowed upon us,” John said in a statement. “It’s an incredible honor for two British guys to be recognized like this. I’m so honored.”  “To be in a house along with the great American songwriters, to even be in the same avenue is humbling, and I am absolutely thrilled to accept,” Taupin said in a statement.

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2024-01-30/russian-figure-skaters-set-to-get-olympic-bronze-ahead-of-canada-despite-valievas-disqualification,"GENEVA (AP) — Despite the disqualification of Kamila Valieva in a doping case, the Russian figure skating team still stands to finish on the podium and get bronze medals from the 2022 Beijing Olympics behind the United States and Japan.  The Americans moved into the gold medal position in the team event and Japan has been upgraded to silver from bronze. The demoted Russians drop into third place, one point ahead of Canada even after being stripped of the points the then-15-year-old Valieva earned on the ice.  The International Skating Union published an amended standings from the Beijing competition on Tuesday that removed Valieva’s maximum 10 points from each of her two events but did not add an extra point to the other teams below her.  The proposal by the ISU is likely to provoke fresh legal action at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which on Monday disqualified Valieva from the 2022 Olympics and other events, and banned her for four years until December 2025.  Russian Olympic officials said Tuesday they will appeal to regain the Olympic title, arguing that ISU rules mean sanctions against Valieva “cannot be the basis for reviewing the results of the team event.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  A second challenge at CAS could come from fourth-place Canada because the rest of the field did not have their points increased by the ISU following Valieva's disqualification.  “Skate Canada strongly disagrees with the ISU’s position on this matter and will consider all options to appeal this decision,” the country’s figure skating body said in a statement Tuesday.  The final decision on awarding medals is for the International Olympic Committee, which the head of the United States Olympic and Paralympic body said Tuesday is “as eager as we are” to get the gold medals to the American skaters.  “There is no scenario at this point in which Team USA is not the gold medal winners,"" USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland told reporters on a call, ""so we are focused on getting the gold medals awarded.”  Skating's world body is responsible for amending the Olympic event result and said Tuesday it had consulted with the IOC.  “The ISU is in close contact with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant ISU member federations in regard to the implementation of this decision,” the governing body said Tuesday.  The unprecedented turmoil of canceling the medal ceremony at the Olympics has tested the rules of figure skating's team event, which debuted at the 2014 Sochi Games. The Russians and Canadians traded gold and silver at the first two editions.  In the newly updated Beijing result, Canada still gets eight points out of 10 from the women’s short program and free skate sections, where its skater was Madeline Schizas. Japan still gets nine points each for originally finishing second to Valieva — Wakaba Higuchi in the short program and Kaori Sakamoto in the free skate.  Canada’s overall point total remained at 53 while the Russians’ tally dropped from 74 to 54 — enough for the bronze medals for everyone on the team except the disqualified Valieva.  Skate Canada praised the ruling to disqualify Valieva, which it said “underscores the significance of stringent anti-doping measures and the need for continuous vigilance in protecting the integrity of figure skating and all sports.”  A Canadian appeal to CAS in Lausanne, Switzerland, could extend the case for about another year.  The team event medal ceremony did not take place in Beijing because details of Valieva's positive test for a banned heart medicine emerged only hours after she skated in the Russian team's win.  One option for getting the medals would be at the Summer Games in Paris that open July 26, U.S. ice dancer Madison Chock said Tuesday.  “That would be the dream scenario ... stand atop a podium at an Olympic event and be there with our families,” Chock said. Asked if that moment could be shared with the Russians, Chock said: “I just want to be standing up there with all nine of us on the top spot of the podium, hand over the heart, singing the national anthem.”  Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine in a sample taken on Dec. 25, 2021, at the Russian national championships. Testing at a World Anti-Doping Agency-approved laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden, was delayed by staffing shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The unusual circumstances, and Valieva's status as a minor, persuaded a separate CAS panel in Beijing to let her continue skating in the individual women's event. Under extreme scrutiny, she finished fourth in an error-filled skate.  Valieva's lawyers argued her positive test was because of contamination from medication they claimed her grandfather took. She also was taking two oxygen-boosting medications not banned in sports.  There was skepticism Valieva was a victim of an institutional culture in Russian sports of doping and lack of duty of care to young athletes. She had competed in Beijing under the team acronym “ROC” — the third straight Olympics the country's athletes could not be called “Russia” because of ongoing fallout from the state-backed doping program at the 2014 Sochi Games at home.  In Russia on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Valieva and her five teammates from two years ago were still considered winners.  “Upon their return from China we honored these athletes as Olympic champions,"" Peskov said. ""We are convinced that they will always remain Olympic champions to us, whatever decisions may be taken in that regard, even unfair ones.”  The IOC executive board will next meet from March 19-21 in Lausanne, at the same time Canada hosts the figure skating world championships in Montreal.  The Olympic leadership is currently in South Korea for the Youth Winter Games and could address the skating medal issue there.  Valieva also lost the European title she won in January 2022, the ISU said.

8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/explainer-how-is-northern-ireland-governed-and-whats-next-after-dup-deal,"BELFAST (Reuters) -Northern Ireland's largest pro-British party said on Tuesday it had agreed a deal with the United Kingdom government on the operation of post-Brexit trade rules that would pave the way for it to return to the region's power-sharing government.  Northern Ireland has had no government for almost two years, since the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out in protest over a trade deal with the European Union, which it said undermined Northern Ireland's place in the UK by requiring checks on some goods coming from Britain.  The party's leader said the power-sharing government - a key part of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement - could be restored within days if the British government acted quickly.  HOW DOES NORTHERN IRELAND'S DEVOLVED GOVERNMENT WORK?  Irish nationalist and pro-British unionist politicians are obliged to share power in the British-run region under the terms of the accord that ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.  However, power-sharing has broken down on several occasions, and the provincial assembly and executive were also suspended between 2017 and 2020.  WHY WAS THE GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED THIS TIME?  When Britain left the EU, it agreed in effect to leave Northern Ireland within the bloc's single market for goods, given its open border with EU member Ireland, enshrined in the Good Friday agreement.  But this put it at odds with Northern Irish unionists, and the DUP quit the government in February 2022 when the checks underpinning the deal began to be implemented. It also opposed a reworked agreement, the Windsor Framework, struck a year later, to reduce the number of checks required on some goods coming from Britain by introducing 'green' and 'red' lanes.  DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said on Tuesday the offer from London to legally cement Northern Ireland's place and trading position in the UK was sufficient for the party to end its boycott.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  Northern Ireland's main parties were due to meet to discuss, and most likely agree to, the restoration later on Tuesday, with Donaldson tying his party's return to the British government ""fully and faithfully"" delivering on what had been agreed, including passing the new legislation.  He said the government could publish a bill as soon as Wednesday. A member of Prime Minister's Rishi Sunak's government said it could be presented to parliament on Thursday.  Once it passes, the Northern Irish parliament at Stormont will meet to elect a first and deputy first minister. For the first time, Irish nationalists Sinn Fein will take the role of first minister after an historic election win shortly after the DUP walkout.  WHAT OBSTACLES ARE AHEAD?  All sides want to move quickly before critics, particularly hardline unionists opposed to any compromise, unpick the proposals and imperil the restoration of the regional government.  Donaldson refused to disclose the margin by which his party's executive voted to accept the new deal on Monday.  Jon Tonge, Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool, told the BBC that DUP lawmakers could yet make trouble, but that he was confident the devolved government would be quickly restored.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the EU would also need to check that the deal did not infringe the Windsor Framework or Good Friday Agreement, but told reporters he did not anticipate any problems.

9,https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2024-01-29/tencent-chief-says-gaming-business-under-threat-catching-up-in-ai,"By Josh Ye  HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pony Ma, chief executive and co-founder of Tencent Holdings, has said that the company's video games business faces great challenges from competitors but is catching up in artificial intelligence (AI) development.  Ma, speaking at Tencent's annual meeting in a stadium in Shenzhen on Monday, said that the company has been resting on its laurels in gaming while competitors have delivered new hits. Video games account for more than 30% of Tencent’s revenue.  Chinese media outlet Jiemian published parts of Ma’s speech online. A person with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named because they are not permitted to speak to the media, confirmed the contents.  Ma’s speech underscores concerns whether Tencent, the world’s biggest gaming company and the operator of China’s biggest social network WeChat, can defend its status as China’s No.1 tech company at a time marked by intensifying competition and new disruptive technologies.  Tencent did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  “Gaming is our flagship business...But in the past year, we have faced significant challenges,” Ma said, “We have found ourselves at a loss, as our competitors continue to produce new products, leaving us feeling having achieved nothing. ”  Ma added that the new games that Tencent has launched had not performed as well as the company had hoped.  Ma’s remarks come at a time when Chinese game developers miHoYo and NetEase have outshone Tencent with hit titles like “Genshin Impact” and “Eggy Party”. While Tencent’s past hits such as “Honor of Kings” and “PUBG Mobile” continue to deliver strong revenue, more recent products are falling short of expectations.  When it comes to AI, Ma said Tencent has caught up. “We can finally follow the pace of the first-tier companies. We don’t count ourselves as the most leading but at least we are not too behind,” he said.  Ma said Tencent’s focus now should be on integrating its “Hunyuan” AI model into different business scenarios as a way to boost efficiency rather than to quickly turn AI into products.  “In the short term, within the next one or two years, I feel like there will not be a massive, AI-native application yet,” he said.  Another focus of Ma’s speech was on live-streaming e-commerce. Tencent has been trying to make WeChat more like ByteDance’ short video platform Douyin in recent years, which has been making massive revenue from live-streaming e-commerce.  “WeChat is our most robust platform regarding daily user amount and its ecosystem. But it is 12 years of age… Now how we can find new sprouts from the old tree that is WeChat is the big question for us,” Ma said.

0,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/washington/articles/2024-01-29/facing-scrutiny-over-quality-control-boeing-withdraws-request-for-safety-exemption,"SEATTLE (AP) — Facing severe criticism after a door plug blew out on a 737 Max over Oregon this month, Boeing said Monday that it is withdrawing a request for a safety exemption needed to certify a new model of the plane.  The company asked federal regulators late last year to allow it to begin delivering its 737 Max 7 airliner to customers even though it does not meet a safety standard designed to prevent part of the engine housing from overheating and breaking off during flight.  But after a door panel blew out on a different version of the plane — a Max 9 — leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines flight out of Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5, the company's quality control and commitment to safety have been questioned.  Last week, Democratic Sens. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Tammy Duckworth, chair of its aviation safety subcommittee, urged the Federal Aviation Administration to deny the request. Boeing said Monday it would withdraw it.  “While Boeing never should have sought this exemption to put another new aircraft with a known safety defect into service in the first place, I’m both relieved and appreciative that they are putting the flying public’s safety first by withdrawing this petition,” Duckworth, of Illinois, said in an emailed statement. “I hope this decision marks the beginning of a turnaround in Boeing’s safety culture.""  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  In its announcement, the company said it was ""committed to being transparent, listening to all our stakeholders and taking action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.”  The safety standard concerns an anti-icing system, and the issue affects other models of the 737 Max that are already flying.  Federal officials said last year that Boeing was working to fix the hazard on current Max planes, and in the meantime regulators urged pilots to limit the de-icing system's use in dry conditions because inlets around the engines could get too hot and parts of the housing could break away and strike the plane, possibly breaking windows and causing rapid decompression.  The issue affects only the Max because it has engine inlets made from carbon composite materials rather than metal.  The company had hoped to be able to deliver its new, smaller Max 7 to customers and have pilots operate the model under the guidance given to Max 8 and Max 9 pilots. It asked for an exemption until May 2026 while it worked on a long-term fix.  In its statement, Boeing said that while it believed the exemption request followed “established FAA processes to ensure safe operation,” the company will “instead incorporate an engineering solution that will be completed during the certification process.”  “This is good news,” Cantwell said in an emailed statement Monday night. ""I hope this means they can quickly develop a compliant design across other MAX planes.”  The FAA grounded all Max 9s in the U.S. the day after the blowout. Last week the agency approved the inspection and maintenance process to return the planes to flying, and Alaska and United Airlines — the only two U.S. airlines that fly Max 9s — began returning some to service in the last few days.  Southwest Airlines, the main customer for the Max 7, reported last week that it had removed the model from its fleet plans for 2024 while Boeing works with the FAA to certify it.  The FAA said last year that it had not received any reports of the overheating problem happening on Max flights, but that it issued the warning to pilots because of the severity of the risk, which was discovered on a test flight.  The 737 Max went into service in May 2017. Two of the planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. All Max jets were grounded worldwide for nearly two years while the company made changes to an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose down based on faulty sensor readings.  More recently, Max deliveries have been interrupted to fix manufacturing flaws, and last month the company told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.  Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal said in a message to Boeing employees Friday that the company’s most immediate goal is to help airlines restore operations.  “Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down,"" he wrote. ""We are deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers, some of whom have been publicly and unfairly criticized.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Facing Scrutiny Over Quality Control, Boeing Withdraws Request for Safety Exemption",20 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
1,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/el-salvadors-bukele-looks-set-for-landslide-election-win-on-gang-crackdown,"By Sarah Kinosian and Nelson Renteria  SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who has described himself as the ""World's Coolest Dictator,"" has in less than five years transformed El Salvador from a country infamous for its record on murder and gangs to a nation with one of the lowest homicide rates in the Americas.  That record means he is all but certain to be re-elected in a presidential election on Sunday for another five-year term - despite a constitutional bar on immediate re-election, voter worries about the economy, and criticism of his draconian crackdown on civil and human rights.  Under him, more than 2% of the adult population of the Central American country is behind bars and several constitutional rights have been shelved, prompting critics to call him a modern day autocrat.  But Salvadorans weary of years of gang violence can live in ways unimaginable before.  Once barred from going to neighborhoods controlled by rival gangs, residents can now freely move around. They can open businesses without paying crushing extortion fees. They can play with their children or sit with friends outside past sunset.  They may be torn over the erosion of civil liberties, but many say they will still support Bukele.  ""Why switch leaders? To go back to the same? We're happy without the gangs and he needs power to keep making change,"" said Elmer Martinez, a 53-year-old construction worker in the capital San Salvador.  Under Bukele, security forces can now arrest anyone without a warrant on evidence as flimsy as an anonymous tip, the government has unfettered access to private communications, and detainees can be held without charge.  Rights groups have denounced the arbitrary arrests of innocent people, torture, and deaths of prisoners in custody.  ""They can take anyone at any time and do whatever they want,"" said Laura, a teacher who declined to give her last name for fear of reprisal. ""This isn't democracy.""  Still, she said she planned to vote for Bukele, adding that for her there were ""no good options.""  A January 2024 opinion poll from the University of Central America's public opinion institute showed 82% of voters supporting Bukele.  At just 4% in polls, the next closest candidate is Manuel ""Chino"" Flores for the legacy left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which ran the country for 10 years prior to Bukele.  With approval ratings that any sitting president would envy, Bukele has become an inspiration for hardline crackdowns on crime elsewhere in Latin America.  ""Bukele proved a 'zero tolerance' model suspending rights works - and quickly,"" said Amparo Marroquin of the University of Central America. ""Now others in Latin America want rapid results in security and the polls, and along with that comes more power in the executive.""  MEDIA MACHINE  Bukele, a 42-year-old former publicist, has alongside the gang crackdown sought to project an image of a transformed, modern nation.  He made El Salvador the world's first to accept bitcoin as legal tender and is a regular on Instagram and TikTok. Rejecting suits in favor of jeans with tight crew-neck sweaters, he set the tone for his presidency when he opened his address to the U.N. General Assembly in 2019 by taking a selfie posted to Twitter, now known as X.  His popularity has been reinforced by a powerful media machine that includes teams of paid internet trolls who flood social networks with government propaganda while whitewashing controversy, manipulating facts, drowning out dissent and targeting journalists and political opponents.  Bukele has warned that a vote for the opposition would mean a return to the past, when El Salvador was known as the ""world's most dangerous country.""  ""The opposition will be able to achieve its true and only plan, to free the gang members,"" Bukele said in a video weeks before the election.  The front page of government newspaper Diario El Salvador on Jan. 23 read: ""War against the gangs could be reversed if the opposition wins more deputies.""  The opposition fiercely denies this. It has warned Bukele is chipping away at El Salvador's young democracy in a country that fought a civil war from 1979 to 1992 to end one-party rule.  ""It's completely untrue that we want to free gang members,"" said Claudia Ortiz, a lawmaker from the emergent Vamos party. ""We want to let innocent people out of jail and investigate with due process.""  Seats in Congress will also be up for grabs on Sunday and Bukele's New Ideas party is predicted to keep its majority.  Recent electoral reforms slashed the size of Congress by nearly a third and consolidated the country's 262 municipalities into 44 districts.  New Ideas says the move will reduce spending, while civil society organizations like Citizen Action say they will reduce smaller parties' participation and ultimately tip the scales in Bukele's favor.  The president has also stacked courts with loyalists who have blocked investigations into an apparent early government pact with the gangs and ministers accused of embezzlement. Their interpretation of the constitution paved the way for him to run for re-election.  In the longer term, Salvadorans say they will need change beyond the security situation. Extreme poverty and hunger rose during Bukele's time in office and state debt shot up.  Many voters Reuters spoke to noted the skyrocketing costs of food and housing that stretch monthly expenses beyond income.  ""Security yes, but everything else is the same – we need improvement in health and education, and most of all, the economy,"" said Marcos Rodriguez, a 60-year-old coffee farmer.

A massive crane delicately moved the orbiter, which is 122 feet (37 meters) long and has a 78-foot (24-meter) wingspan, into the partially built Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center at the California Science Center in Exposition Park.  Crews then attached Endeavour, covered in a protective wrapping, to the tank in a process that lasted into the predawn hours Tuesday. The building will be completed around Endeavour before the display opens to the public.  “This is a huge morning for us now,"" said Jeffrey N. Rudolph, president and CEO of the science center, who estimated it will take up to two years to finish the project.  “The scale of it is something that really amazes people,” he said. “Everyone who sees it, even those who’ve seen the shuttle before, they say wow.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The 20-story-tall display stands atop an 1,800-ton (1,633-metric ton) concrete slab supported by six so-called base isolators to protect Endeavour from earthquakes.  All parts of the vertical launch configuration are authentic components of the shuttle system, including the rust-colored external tank, which was flight-qualified.  “It's incredible,” said Larry Clark, a veteran NASA contractor who spent nearly his whole career as a shuttle engineer and is a consultant to the science center's project.  “It brings back a lot of memories for me,” he said. “You know, I saw every space shuttle on the launch pad that ever flew as I worked on the launch pad, and to stand here and see it again like this is kind of melancholy.”  Clark described the work completed early Tuesday as a “soft mate.” The attachments will be further tightened Wednesday.  Endeavour flew 25 missions between 1992 and 2011, when NASA’s shuttle program ended.  The shuttle was flown to Los Angeles International Airport in 2012 atop a NASA Boeing 747 and then created a spectacle as it was inched through tight city streets to Exposition Park. The external tank arrived by barge and made a similar trip across the city.  The shuttle was initially displayed horizontally in a temporary exhibit hall. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Air and Space Center was held in 2022 on the 11th anniversary of Endeavour’s final return from space.  The process of assembling the shuttle system in vertical configuration was dubbed “Go for Stack,” an informal term for putting together rocket components for launch.  It began in July with precise installation of the bottom segments of the side boosters, known as aft skirts, for the first time outside of a NASA facility. In use, the boosters would be attached to the external tank to help the shuttle's main engines lift off.  The 116-foot-long (35.3-meter-long) rocket motors were trucked to Los Angeles from the Mojave Desert in October and installed the following month.  In addition to completing the building, about 100 other aircraft and spacecraft will be installed along with numerous interpretive exhibits, Rudolph said. About $360 million of the $400 million cost has been raised.  In all, NASA operated five shuttles in space. Shuttle Challenger was lost and its crew of seven died in a launch accident Jan. 28, 1986. Columbia broke apart during reentry on Feb. 1, 2003, killing all seven on board. Retired shuttles Atlantis and Discovery and the test ship Enterprise, which did not go to space, are on display across the country.  Atlantis is at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, where it is displayed as if in orbit with its payload doors open and robotic arm extended. Discovery rests on its landing gear at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.

Kara-Murza said in the letter, published by his wife Evgenia on Tuesday, that the move was punishment for not standing up when a guard commanded him to ""rise"", which he said the authorities had deemed a ""malicious violation"".  Kara-Murza said he had been sent to a type of punishment cell known by its Russian initials as an EPKT, the strictest form of isolation from other inmates.  He wrote ironically that the point of the transfer was ""so that life doesn’t seem like honey"".  Kara-Murza, who had condemned Russia's war in Ukraine and lobbied for Western sanctions against Moscow, was sentenced to 25 years last April on treason and other charges that he denied, comparing the case against him to a Stalinist show trial.  It was the harshest sentence imposed on an opposition politician since the start of the war. Putin's best-known opponent, Alexei Navalny, was already in jail at the time of the invasion and has since had his term extended by 19 years to more than three decades on new charges related to ""extremism"".  Kara-Murza suffers from a neural condition after surviving two attempts to poison him, and his wife Evgenia has voiced fears for his life in prison. On Monday she sounded the alarm after he was moved without explanation from his previous prison.  Kara-Murza wrote that his new penal colony, IK-7, was a short drive from the previous one in the city of Omsk.  ""Everything is okay with me – I’m clothed, shod, fed and warm, the people here are all fine,"" he said.  But referring to the prison writings of Russian novelists Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he noted the unsettling effect of being moved suddenly from one colony to another. He said he expected to be transferred back in four months.  Kara-Murza is a Russian and British citizen and was a close aide to opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated in central Moscow in 2015.

Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found 23 countries at their worst level since the global ranking began almost three decades ago, including both high-ranking democracies and authoritarian states.  On the reported decline in justice, the group said that “the rise of authoritarianism in some countries contributes to this trend, and even in democratic contexts, the mechanisms that keep governments in check have weakened.”  “Corruption will continue to thrive until justice systems can punish wrongdoing and keep governments in check,"" Transparency International chair François Valérian said in a statement. He added that ""leaders should fully invest in and guarantee the independence of institutions that uphold the law and tackle corruption.”  The organization measures the perception of public sector corruption according to 13 data sources including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and private risk and consulting companies. It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a “highly corrupt” 0 to a “very clean” 100.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Among the countries hitting their lowest level were relatively high-scoring democracies such as Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain. Authoritarian countries including Iran, Russia and Venezuela also dropped.  Denmark led the index with the highest score for the sixth consecutive year, with 90. It was followed by Finland with 87 and New Zealand with 85. The others in the top 10 were Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.  The United States was unchanged with a score of 69, putting it in 24th place.  At the other end, Somalia again had the weakest score with 11. It was followed by South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela with 13 each; Yemen with 16; and Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, North Korea and Nicaragua with 17 each.  The global average was unchanged at 43 for the 12th consecutive year, and more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50.  The report found “little to no meaningful progress” toward curbing corruption in the Asia-Pacific region, and expressed concerns about “opacity and undue influence” in justice systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.

7,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/explainer-why-hong-kong-wants-new-national-security-laws,"By Greg Torode and Jessie Pang  HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government announced on Tuesday that it hopes to swiftly pass new national security laws. A public consultation document was also released. A deadline for its eventual passage into law has yet to be announced.  WHAT ARE THE NEW LAWS LIKELY TO INVOLVE?  The package, known as Article 23, is designed to update or create news laws to prohibit treason, sabotage, sedition, the theft of state secrets and espionage as well tightening control over foreign political bodies and organisations operating in the city.  The need for those specific laws is briefly stipulated in Article 23 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitutional document that has guided Hong Kong's relations with its Chinese sovereign since its handover from British colonial rule in 1997.  A previous attempt to enact Article 23 in 2003 was shelved after an estimated 500,000 people staged a peaceful protest against proposals.  ISN'T HONG KONG ALREADY SUBJECT TO NATIONAL SECURITY LAWS?  Yes. It has several old, vague and arcane laws from its days as a British colony that remain on the books.  Beijing also imposed a sweeping national security law on its freest city in 2020, with officials saying it was needed to bring stability after months of pro-democracy protests rocked Hong Kong in 2019.  That law dealt with only some offences, such as collusion with foreign forces, and also allowed mainland national security officers to be based in the city for the first time.  It also created a provision where suspects could be sent for trial in the mainland, where the courts are under the control of the ruling Communist Party.  The 2020 law highlighted the need for Hong Kong to continue its work on Article 23, creating local legislation. Senior Hong Kong officials say it is need to fill legal holes, particularly to deal with what they describe as ""soft resistance"" after 2019, and internet control.  Security chief Chris Tang has repeatedly said the government needs better tools to deal with espionage and the activities of foreign agents in the city.  WHAT IMPACT COULD THEY HAVE?  Businesses including foreign banks, hedge funds and private research operations, along with diplomats and academics are watching developments closely. Some are concerned the bill could lead to controls on the internet or impact data operations.  The consultation document does create a new sabotage offence of unlawfully using a computer or electronic system to endanger national security.  Research of China's politics, economy and military and due diligence investigations into individuals and companies on the Chinese mainland - all traditionally carried out by some Hong Kong firms and academics - could stray into areas of state secrecy, some fear.  The consultation document defines a list of state secrets in Hong Kong, including economic, scientific, diplomatic and social secrets, but says to be classed as such they would have to endanger national security if released.  Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school, said while many unknowns remained, he thought the law would ultimately adopt broad definitions for both a foreign political organisation and a foreign agent.  ""It may well be that businesses or groups that have some connection with foreign governments might be captured here,"" Young said.  Hong Kong's leader John Lee said on Tuesday and the laws would meet international standards and protect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms.  DOESN'T CHINA ALREADY HAVE A STATE SECRETS LAW?  Reflecting the priorities of President Xi Jinping, China updated its own state secrets laws in 2023, banning the transfer of any information related to national security and broadening the definition of espionage. Some analysts say it remains vague.  Hong Kong's own version has to deal with state secrets but with legislation compatible with the standards of the British-based common law, of which it remains a part.  Hong Kong could bridge the two with some tight definitions of what is protected, bringing clarity, but ""the mainland concept and legal definition of state secrets still looms large and we can't ignore that,"" Young said.  WILL THE NEW LAWS PASS EASILY?  Unlike the tensions that surrounding the bill in 2003, the final Article 23 bill is expected to pass easily and relatively swiftly, after formal readings of the bill and some debate in the Legislative Council. Changes to Hong Kong's electoral system after 2019 mean that pro-establishment figures screened as ""patriots"" control the body.

The tentative agreement, reached late Monday, still needs formal approval but is seen as a first step toward using some of the 200 billion euros ($216 billion) in Russian central bank assets in the EU to help Ukraine rebuild from Russian destruction.  The official, who asked not to be identified since the agreement was not yet legally ratified, said the bloc “would allow to start collecting the extraordinary revenues generated from the frozen assets ... to support the reconstruction of Ukraine.”  How the proceeds will be used will be decided later, as the issue remains mired in legal and practical considerations.  There is urgency since Ukraine is struggling to make ends meet, and aid plans in the EU and the United States are being held back over political considerations including whether allies will continue helping Ukraine at the same pace as they did in the first two years of the war.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  EU leaders will meet on Thursday hoping to approve a 50-billion-euro ($54 billion) support package for Ukraine over the solitary opposition of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.  Even if using the unfrozen assets, which now go untapped, seems like a practical step to take, many fear that financial weaponization could harm the standing of the EU in global financial markets.  Early this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a “strong” decision this year for the frozen assets in Western banks to “be directed towards defense against the Russian war and for reconstruction” of Ukraine.  The EU step late Monday paves the way if EU nations ever want to impose such measures. Group of Seven allies of Ukraine are still looking for an adequate legal framework to pursue the plan.  The U.S. announced at the start of Russia’s invasion that America and its allies had blocked access to more than $600 billion that Russia held outside its borders — including roughly $300 billion in funds belonging to Russia’s central bank. Since then, the U.S and its allies have continued to impose rounds of targeted sanctions against companies and wealthy elites with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in March 2023, estimates that costs for the nation's reconstruction and recovery will be $411 billion over the next 10 years, which includes needs for public and private funds.

The Homeland Security Committee is pushing through a day-long hearing on two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas, a rare charge against a Cabinet official unseen in nearly 150 years, as Republicans make GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump’s hard-line deportation approach to immigration their own.  “The actions and decisions of Secretary Mayorkas have left us with no other option but to proceed with articles of impeachment,"" said Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn.  The articles charge that Mayorkas “willfully and systematically refused to comply with Federal immigration laws” amid a record surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and that he has “breached the public trust” in his claims to Congress that the border is secure. A committee vote would send the articles to the full House for a vote as soon as next week.  ""We cannot allow this man to remain in office any longer,” Green said.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  With an unusual personal appeal Mayorkas wrote in a letter to the committee that it should be working with the Biden administration to update the nation’s “broken and outdated” immigration laws for the 21st century and an era of record global migration.  “We need a legislative solution and only Congress can provide it,” Mayorkas wrote in the pointed letter to the panel’s chairman.  Mayorkas never testified on his own behalf during the rushed impeachment proceedings — he and the committee couldn’t agree on a date — but drew on his own background as a child brought to the U.S. by his parents fleeing Cuba and on his career spent prosecuting criminals.  “Your false accusations do not rattle me and do not divert me” from public service, he wrote.  Green, the Republican committee chair, disparaged Mayorkas’s letter as an “11th-hour response"" to the committee that was “inadequate and unbecoming of a Cabinet secretary.”  Rarely has a Cabinet member faced impeachment’s bar of “high crimes and misdemeanors” and Democrats on the panel called the proceedings a stunt and a sham that could set a chilling precedent for other civil servants snared in policy disputes by lawmakers who disagree with the president's approach.  “This is a terrible day for the committee, the United States, the Constitution and our great country,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee's ranking Democrat.  Referring to Trump's campaign slogan, Thompson said the “MAGA-led impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas is a baseless sham.”  The House’s proceedings against Mayorkas have created an oddly split-screen Capitol Hill, as the Senate works intently with the secretary on a bipartisan border security package that is now on life support.  The package being negotiated by the senators with Mayorkas could emerge as the most consequential bipartisan immigration proposal in a decade. Or it could collapse in political failure as Republicans, and some Democrats, run from the effort.  Trump, on the campaign trail and in private talks, has tried to squelch the deal. ""I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill,"" Trump said over the weekend in Las Vegas.  President Joe Biden, in his own campaign remarks in South Carolina, said if Congress sends him a bill with emergency authority he'll “shut down the border right now” to get migration under control.  “I’ve done all I can do,” Biden told reporters Tuesday before departing for a campaign-related trip to Florida. “Give me the power"" through legislation, which he said is something he's asked ""from the very day I got in office.”  The Republicans are focused on the secretary’s handling of the southern border, which has experienced a increasing number of migrants over the past year, many seeking asylum in the U.S., at a time when drug cartels are using the border with Mexico to traffic people and ship deadly fentanyl into the states.  Rep, Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a Trump ally often mentioned as vice presidential pick, called it an “invasion.”  Republicans contend that the Biden administration and Mayorkas either got rid of policies in place under Trump that had controlled migration or enacted policies of their own that encouraged migrants from around the world to come to the U.S. illegally via the southern border.  Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden and Mayorkas have “created a catastrophe” on the border, and he criticized the emerging Senate package. The GOP leader said the president is now trying to turn the blame back on Congress for failing to update immigration laws.  The Republicans also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to the U.S. after military withdrawal from their country.  “It’s high time"" for impeachment, said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who called Mayorkas the “architect” of the border problems. “He has what’s coming to him.”  The House impeachment hearings against Mayorkas sprinted ahead in January while the Republicans’ separate impeachment inquiry into Biden over the business dealings over his son Hunter Biden dragged.  Democrats argue that Mayorkas is acting under his legal authorities at the department and that the criticisms against him do not rise to the level of impeachment.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York called the proceedings a “political stunt” ordered up by Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Trump ally, who pushed the resolution forward toward the votes.  During the hearing, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., pointed to Trump's comments echoing Adolf Hitler that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the U.S. and to his proposals for militarizing the border as extreme, arguing the impeachment proceedings were “all about trying to get Donald Trump re-elected.”  It's unclear if House Republicans will have the support from their ranks to go through with the impeachment after a committee vote, especially with their slim majority and with Democrats expected to vote against it.  Last year, eight House Republicans voted to shelve the impeachment resolution proposed by Greene rather than send it along to the committee, though many of them have since signaled they would be open to it.  If the House does agree to impeach Mayorkas, the charges would next to go the Senate for a trial. In 1876, the House impeached Defense Secretary William Belknap over kickbacks in government contracts, but the Senate acquitted him in a trial.  __  Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",House Republicans Taking a Key Vote Toward Impeaching Mayorkas as Border Becomes 2024 Campaign Issue,13 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found 23 countries at their worst level since the global ranking began almost three decades ago, including both high-ranking democracies and authoritarian states.  On the reported decline in justice, the group said that “the rise of authoritarianism in some countries contributes to this trend, and even in democratic contexts, the mechanisms that keep governments in check have weakened.”  “Corruption will continue to thrive until justice systems can punish wrongdoing and keep governments in check,"" Transparency International chair François Valérian said in a statement. He added that ""leaders should fully invest in and guarantee the independence of institutions that uphold the law and tackle corruption.”  The organization measures the perception of public sector corruption according to 13 data sources including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and private risk and consulting companies. It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a “highly corrupt” 0 to a “very clean” 100.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Among the countries hitting their lowest level were relatively high-scoring democracies such as Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain. Authoritarian countries including Iran, Russia and Venezuela also dropped.  Denmark led the index with the highest score for the sixth consecutive year, with 90. It was followed by Finland with 87 and New Zealand with 85. The others in the top 10 were Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.  The United States was unchanged with a score of 69, putting it in 24th place.  At the other end, Somalia again had the weakest score with 11. It was followed by South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela with 13 each; Yemen with 16; and Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, North Korea and Nicaragua with 17 each.  The global average was unchanged at 43 for the 12th consecutive year, and more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50.  The report found “little to no meaningful progress” toward curbing corruption in the Asia-Pacific region, and expressed concerns about “opacity and undue influence” in justice systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Arab countries’ average score on the index hit an all-time low of 34, and sub-Saharan Africa remained stagnant at 33.

The GOP leader said the president is now trying to turn the blame back on Congress for failing to update immigration laws.  The Republicans also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to the U.S. after military withdrawal from their country.  “It’s high time"" for impeachment, said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who called Mayorkas the “architect” of the border problems. “He has what’s coming to him.”  The House impeachment hearings against Mayorkas sprinted ahead in January while the Republicans’ separate impeachment inquiry into Biden over the business dealings over his son Hunter Biden dragged.  Democrats argue that Mayorkas is acting under his legal authorities at the department and that the criticisms against him do not rise to the level of impeachment.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York called the proceedings a “political stunt” ordered up by Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Trump ally, who pushed the resolution forward toward the votes.  During the hearing, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., pointed to Trump's comments echoing Adolf Hitler that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the U.S. and to his proposals for militarizing the border as extreme, arguing the impeachment proceedings were “all about trying to get Donald Trump re-elected.”  It's unclear if House Republicans will have the support from their ranks to go through with the impeachment after a committee vote, especially with their slim majority and with Democrats expected to vote against it.  Last year, eight House Republicans voted to shelve the impeachment resolution proposed by Greene rather than send it along to the committee, though many of them have since signaled they would be open to it.  If the House does agree to impeach Mayorkas, the charges would next to go the Senate for a trial. In 1876, the House impeached Defense Secretary William Belknap over kickbacks in government contracts, but the Senate acquitted him in a trial.  __  Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",House Republicans Taking a Key Vote Toward Impeaching Mayorkas as Border Becomes 2024 Campaign Issue,13 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
4,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/with-police-stops-in-the-spotlight-nyc-council-is-expected-to-override-mayor-on-transparency-bill,"New York City police officers will be required to record the apparent race, gender and ages of most people they stop for questioning under a law passed Tuesday by the City Council, which overrode a veto by Mayor Eric Adams.  The issue was thrust into the national spotlight in recent days when NYPD officers pulled over a Black council member without giving him a reason.  The law gives police reform advocates a major win in requiring the nation’s largest police department and its 36,000 officers to document all investigative encounters in a city that once had officers routinely stop and frisk huge numbers of men for weapons — a strategy that took a heavy toll on communities of color.  It requires officers to document basic information in low-level encounters, where police ask for information from people who aren’t necessarily suspected of a crime.  Officers also will have to report the circumstances that led to stopping a particular person. The data would be made public on the police department's website.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  City Council Member Kevin Riley, a Bronx Democrat who is Black, related his own experience of being detained by police simply for hunting for a parking spot on Manhattan’s Upper West Side while fresh out of college as he voted for the law.  “This is something we deal with on a daily basis,” he said. “When we see those red and blue lights, our hearts drop into our stomachs.”  New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who sponsored the bill, said that reporting the encounters could be done in less than a minute on an officer’s smartphone through a system already in place.  Since 2001, NYPD officers have been required to document instances in which they have asked someone “accusatory” questions as part of an investigation, detain or search someone or arrest them.  “This is not about preventing police work,” Williams said. “This is police work.”  The mayor, a Democrat and former police captain, has said the reporting requirements for low-level stops would be too time-consuming for officers, forcing them to fill out forms every time they speak to a person rather than focusing on solving a crime.  “If you talk to the victim of a crime or law enforcement professional, they will tell you: in public safety, seconds matter,” Adams said Tuesday at City Hall as he implored the council to let his veto stand.  Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a Democrat who is not related to the mayor, pushed back Tuesday, saying opponents were exaggerating how much of a burden the new requirements would be. The law doesn’t require officers to document casual conversations, such as providing directions, which are explicitly exempt under the requirements, she stressed.  “There should not be resistance to telling people who is being stopped in this city and why,” she said.  Republicans, by far the minority on the council, raised their own objections Tuesday, with some suggesting the bill only served to further racial divisions in a city that’s seen its share of otherwise innocuous police stops turn deadly.  “Please don’t make this a racial issue. It isn’t,” Council Member Vickie Paladino, a Queens Republican who is white, said after a number of her council peers spoke strongly in favor of the bill, with a number even speaking in Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin and Haitian Creole.  Others noted that this coming Sunday marks the 25th anniversary of when a young, unarmed Black immigrant named Amadou Diallo was shot dozens of times by NYPD officers in the Bronx.  “We didn’t make this a race thing,” Riley said. “This is a race thing.”  In 2013, a federal judge ruled that the NYPD violated the civil rights of Black and Hispanic residents with its stop-and-frisk tactic. Since then, the department has reported a large decline in such encounters, though an ACLU report found people of color were still the targets of the vast majority of stop-and-frisks in 2022.  After the council first approved the How Many Stops Act in December, Adams and the NYPD publicly campaigned against it. On Friday night, the mayor hosted a police ride-along for council members in an effort to sway some lawmakers from voting to override his veto.  But the event was overshadowed that same evening when an officer pulled over Council Member Yusef Salaam, an exonerated member of the “Central Park Five” who with four other Black and Latino men were falsely accused and convicted of raping a white jogger in Central Park in 1989. Their convictions were eventually overturned through DNA evidence.  In the very brief encounter, an officer asked Salaam to roll down his windows and identified himself. Salaam told the officer he was on the City Council and asked why he was pulled over, according to audio of the encounter published by The New York Times.  The officer told Salaam, “Oh, OK. Have a good one” before walking away, body camera footage showed. The NYPD later released a statement that said Salaam was pulled over for driving with dark window tints beyond the legal limit.  Though such a stop would not be covered by the transparency law — police already have to record information when they pull a driver over — Salaam argued that it showed the need for greater police transparency.  “This experience only amplified the importance of transparency for all police investigative stops, because the lack of transparency allows racial profiling and unconstitutional stops of all types to occur and often go underreported,” Salaam said in a statement.  The council on Tuesday also overrode Adams’ veto of a bill that would restrict the use of solitary confinement in the city’s jails.  The law places a four-hour limit on isolating inmates who pose an immediate risk of violence to others or themselves in “de-escalation” units. Only those involved in violent incidents could be placed in longer-term restrictive housing, and they would need to be allowed out of their cells for 14 hours each day and get access to the same programming available to other inmates.  In his letter vetoing that bill, Adams argued the restrictions would put inmates and corrections officers alike at risk. He also cited concerns raised by a federal monitor appointed to evaluate operations at the city’s jails.  —-  Associated Press writer Ruth Brown in New York contributed to this report.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",NYPD Officers Will Have to Record Race of People They Question in Law Aimed at Police Transparency,18 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Also, that Nikola Jokic continues to be next-level at everything he does.  Jokic spoiled Rivers' debut as Milwaukee coach by recording his 14th triple-double of the season to help the Denver Nuggets surge by the Bucks, 113-107.  “They’re great,” Rivers said of his new squad. “They’re a very coachable team.”  Jokic finished with 25 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists. Jamal Murray scored 35 for the Nuggets, who gained separation during a late 8-0 run.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The game was a chance for Rivers to size up his built-to-win-now club. Bucks players made an instant impression with him — and he on them.  “He did a great job commanding the team, leading the team,” forward Khris Middleton said. “It's going to take time for us to get used to him and him to see what we’ve been doing and how we’ve been successful so far this season and in the past.”  Rivers was lured out of his role as an analyst to take over for first-year Bucks coach Adrian Griffin, who was fired after 43 games and a 30-13 record.  Embarking on his 25th season as an NBA head coach, Rivers alternated between arms folded, hands on his knees and hands on hips in moving up and down the sideline. He kneeled at times, clapped, consulted with Joe Prunty, the interim coach before Rivers' arrival, and even showed frustration over a foul called on Brook Lopez late in the game for an illegal screen.  Rivers watched his new team squander an early 13-point lead, fall behind by nine and then fight back before Aaron Gordon ended the comeback by blocking Damian Lillard's layup attempt with 24.7 seconds remaining.  The game featured 12 ties and nine lead changes.  “I mean, that’s why I play — to play these kinds of games, to play under the pressure, to play tight games,” Jokic said. “I like to play under those circumstances.”  The win was a milestone for Michael Malone — victory No. 400 as coach of the Nuggets.  The significance?  “It means that I’ve been here a long time,” Malone cracked.  Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, who began a five-game trip. The “Greek Freak” played nearly 37 minutes despite dealing with an illness that had his availability up in the air leading into the game. Had he missed the contest, it would’ve been the second straight game in which an NBA MVP didn’t play at Ball Arena. On Saturday, reigning MVP Joel Embiid was a late scratch for Philadelphia because of a balky left knee.  But Antetokounmpo treated the capacity crowd to a high-flying exhibition (and was called for a 10-second violation on a free throw that electrified fans). He was named the NBA player of the week for the East earlier in the day.  “I try to thrive in those moments as much as I can,"" Antetokounmpo said of going against players such as Jokic. “And learn as much as I can.""  Lopez had 19 points, including five of Milwaukee's 16 3-pointers. Lillard finished with 18 points.  Rivers conceded it will take a minute to settle in on the bench as he steadily meshes his style with the way the Bucks already play. He wants them flowing along and not overthinking.  One thing he doesn't have to remind them of — just how good they are. The Bucks feature several holdovers, led by Antetokounmpo, from the team that won the NBA championship in 2020-21.  “They already know what the goal is,” Rivers said. ""And they all know that the only way you reach that goal is it has to be ‘We’ — as a group.”  UP NEXT  Bucks: Lillard returns to Portland on Wednesday to face his former team.

8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-29/hong-kong-leaders-start-legislative-push-to-tighten-national-security-laws,"By Jessie Pang and Greg Torode  HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong's leader confirmed on Tuesday his intention to tighten national security laws to build on sweeping legislation China imposed in 2020, saying the city ""could not afford to wait"".  Some business people, diplomats and academics are watching developments closely, saying the prospect of new laws targeting espionage, state secrets and foreign influence, known as Article 23, could have a deep impact on the global financial hub.  Critics have denounced the 2020 legislation as a clampdown on dissent in the former British colony. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say it was needed to restore stability after sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that swept the territory a year earlier.  Chief Executive John Lee said the government will attempt to pass the laws ""as soon as possible"" but did not give a precise timetable for them to be approved by the city's legislature.  ""Why now? We can't wait. I've said it very clearly. We can't afford to wait. It's for 26 years we've been waiting. We shouldn't wait any longer,"" Lee said, describing it as the city's constitutional responsibility dating back to its 1997 handover to China from British rule.  ""While we, society as a whole, look calm and look very safe, we still have to watch out for potential sabotage, undercurrents that try to create troubles,"" he said, saying some foreign agents could still be active in Hong Kong.  Lee said the city's freedoms would be safeguarded and the laws would meet international standards.  A 110-page consultation document was sent to the Legislative Council on Tuesday and the consultation will end on Feb. 28.  The document outlines the need for new and updated laws covering the theft of state secrets, espionage, treason, sedition and sabotage, including the use of computers and electronic systems to conduct actions endangering national security.  Tighter control of foreign and Taiwanese political organisations linked to the city is also advocated under proposals for a new offence of ""external interference"".  ""External forces"" had been using the city ""as a bridgehead for anti-China activities...and propagating anti-China ideology through a soft approach to demonise"" the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. It noted ""monitoring of human rights"" as one of the ""guises"".  The consultation document warns that Hong Kong is under increasing threat from foreign espionage and intelligence operations, and cites the 2019 protests.  China and Hong Kong are ""unavoidably subject to acts and activities endangering national security conducted by the agents or spies of external forces (including external political organisations or intelligence agencies)"" in the city, it notes.  It defines a list of state secrets in Hong Kong, including economic, scientific and diplomatic information, but says that for something to be classed as a state secret it would have to endanger national security if released.  SHARPER LAWS  While Chinese and Hong Kong government officials said the 2020 law was vital to restoring stability, the new package has long been required under Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law.  That document guides the city's relationship with its Chinese sovereign after 1997, and Article 23 stipulates that the city ""shall enact laws on its own to prohibit acts and activities that endanger national security"".  Some legal scholars say the new, local legislation could sharpen the at times vaguely worded 2020 law, and older colonial-era laws considered unworkable.  ""It almost certainly will set red lines where the existing laws are vague, particularly in defining state secrets and espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school.  For example, the colonial-era espionage law refers to an ""enemy"" - a term the document describes as too restrictive, preferring to expand the law to cover peacetime ""external forces"" as well, including foreign governments, organisations and individuals.  It also calls for consideration of ending early paroles when offences involve national security.  Lee said repeatedly that he believed the new laws would create a more stable and safe city and ultimately serve the interests of individuals, businesses and private organisations.  ""Our legislation, of course, is subject to scrutiny by both Hong Kong people....and international people,"" he said.  ""We are confident, we are proud, and we stand high because the principles we adopt conform with the international standard.""  The document cites similar laws in Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore.  A previous government attempt to pass Article 23 was shelved after an estimated 500,000 people staged a peaceful protest in 2003, forcing the resignation of the then security minister.  But the staging of such protests is now a thing of the past, a traditional venting of opinion curbed by the enforcement and provisions of the 2020 legislation.

Zhevago, who controls London-listed iron pellet producer Ferrexpo, was being sued on behalf of the bank in which he had a 95% indirect shareholding before its 2015 collapse.  WWRT Ltd, a company that claims it was ultimately assigned Finance & Credit Bank's right to sue, brought the case at London's High Court. It accused Zhevago of procuring loans from the bank to companies controlled by him.  Zhevago, who served in Ukraine's parliament from 1998 to 2019, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and argued that any case relating to the alleged fraud should not be heard in London.  Judge Richard Jacobs upheld Zhevago's challenge in a written ruling delivered on Friday. Lawyers representing Zhevago and WWRT did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The ruling is a victory for Zhevago, 50, who is facing legal challenges amid Ukraine's efforts to clamp down on corruption despite Russia's full-scale invasion, which is vital to meet the conditions for joining the European Union.  He was arrested at a French ski resort in 2022 at the request of Ukraine. Zhevago has since been released on bail and successfully resisted attempts to extradite him.  Ukrainian prosecutors have also taken action in the Ukrainian courts against Zhevago and frozen shares held by Ferrexpo, in its three Ukrainian subsidiaries.

Major trade partner China approached PNG in September with an offer to assist its police force with training, equipment and surveillance technology, PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkachenko told Reuters on Monday.  Talks were at an early stage, and PNG would not jeopardise its security ties with Australia and the United States, he added.  PNG struck a A$200 million security agreement with Australia in December to boost police training, after forging a defence agreement with the United States in May, although both deals are yet to be implemented.  ""We are the security partner of choice for Papua New Guinea, as we are for most of the countries in the Pacific,"" Albanese told reporters on Tuesday, in response to questions.  China's ambassador to Australia said this month Beijing has a strategy to help Pacific Island nations with policing, not defence, and its growing presence in the region should not alarm Australia.  In a statement on Tuesday, Tkachenko said China's offer of policing and internal security assistance was ""being carefully assessed, as we do not want to duplicate or compromise agreements already in place with our traditional security partners, Australia and the United States of America"".  PNG has previously said it saw China as an economic partner, and Australia and the United States as security partners.  ""We have a long standing and genuine relationship with China, where we can agree to disagree,"" Tkachenko added.

The first two episodes of “Expats,” a six-episode drama about expat women, were released on Amazon Prime on Jan. 26. But when viewers in Hong Kong try to watch it, they instead get a message saying that “this video is currently unavailable to watch in your location.”  The city has hardened its controls over political speech after 2019 anti-government protests rocked the city.  In 2020, China passed a National Security Law that criminalized political activities, such as protesting for independence. Since then, hundreds of activists have been arrested or driven into exile, while opposition-leaning media have been forced out of business.  “Expats” is based on a book by Hong Kong-born American writer Janice Y.K. Lee, and is directed by China-born American director Lulu Wang. The first episode includes a brief scene in which people at a rally chant in Cantonese “I want real general elections.” The trailer for the show also features a crowd holding umbrellas, a reference to the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when protesters demanded the right to choose the city's Chief Executive.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Previously, the Walt Disney Co. removed an episode of the cartoon series The Simpsons that included a reference to “forced labor camps” in China from its Disney Plus streaming service in Hong Kong. In both cases, it's not clear whether authorities were involved in the decision to pull the content or companies acted on their own.  In June 2021, the city's government changed the Film Censorship Ordinance to give them the power to remove films which include “portrayal, depiction or treatment of any act or activity which may amount to an offense endangering national security.”  A spokesperson at the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said the government was not commenting on the issue, and directed questions to Amazon.  Representatives of Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The measure has been promised by President Emmanuel Macron following a rollback of abortion rights in the United States.  The bill was voted Tuesday evening by the lower house of parliament by 493 votes for and 30 against.  “Tonight, the National Assembly and the government did not miss their rendez-vous with women's history,” Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said.  Macron’s government wants Article 34 of France's constitution amended to include that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  A constitutional amendment must pass both chambers of parliament and then be approved either in a referendum or by a three-fifths majority of a joint session of parliament. Macron's government is aiming for the second method, though the measure's level of support in the Senate is less certain than in the National Assembly.  None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament is questioning the right to abortion.  Yet some members of the conservative majority in the Senate have criticized the wording of the proposal, making its passage there more uncertain. If the same version of the bill ultimately passes both houses, Macron would call a special session of all legislators in attempts to win a three-fifths vote.  Abortion in France was decriminalized under a 1975 law, but there is nothing in the constitution that would guarantee abortion rights.  The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that had guaranteed the right to an abortion.  “Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says.

The recall notice, issued by Azurity Pharmaceuticals Inc., states that one lot of Zenzedi 30-milligram tablets is being recalled after a pharmacist found antihistamine tablets in a bottle labeled as Zenzedi.  The active compound in Zenzedi is dextroamphetamine sulfate, a stimulant used for the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD. Meanwhile, the allergy drug found in the mislabeled bottles contains the sedative carbinoxamine, which has the opposite effect of a stimulant.  The recall comes amid an ongoing national shortage of ADHD drugs, creating further frustration for people with ADHD who have struggled to find medications for their condition, CNN reported.  The recall notice said that people who take carbinoxamine instead of Zenzedi have a higher risk of accidents or injuries and may have drowsiness, increased eye pressure, urinary obstruction and thyroid disorder. The recalled lot has the lot number F230169A and an expiration date of June 2025.  Azurity added that it has not received any reports of serious injury related to the medication mixup.  Consumers who have the recalled medication should return it to their pharmacy and call their doctor if they have any bad reactions to the drug.  Problems may also be reported to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.  More information  Drugs.com has more on Zenzedi.

Orban's remarks, published by French magazine Le Point on Tuesday, come a day after Orban's political director said Hungary was open to using the EU budget for a proposed 50 billion euro ($54 billion) aid package for Kyiv.  ""Hungary is ready to participate in the solution of the 27 (EU member nations) if you guarantee that each year we will decide whether or not to send this money. And this annual decision must have the same legal basis as today: it must be unanimous"", Orban was quoted as saying.  Orban has been a vocal critic of the European Union's financial and military support for Kyiv and has maintained close ties with the Kremlin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Hungary was the only EU state not to back the aid package at a summit in December.  In the interview, Orban also said he was certain a report by the Financial Times saying the European Union would sabotage Hungary's economy if Budapest continued to block fresh aid to Ukraine at a summit this week, was credible.  ""If the Financial Times publishes a document detailing the scenario of a financial blockade of Hungary and blackmail against us, we can be sure that it exists"", he said.

5,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-29/hong-kong-begins-public-consultation-to-implement-domestic-national-security-law,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong began public consultation on a local National Security Law on Tuesday, more than three years after Beijing imposed a similar law that has all but wiped out dissent in the semi-autonomous city.  The new law could expand the government's ability to prosecute residents for offenses like collaborating with foreign forces to influence legislation or “publish misleading statements,” and to close down civil society organizations. Some of its provisions threaten criminal prosecutions for acts committed anywhere in the world.  Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, calls for the city to enact a national security law, but it's been delayed for decades because of widespread public opposition based on fears it would erode civil liberties. In 2003, an attempt to pass a version of the law sparked street protests that drew half a million people, and the legislation was shelved.  But the city's crackdown on political opposition likely clears the way for the bill to pass easily. Since 2020, many of the city’s leading pro-democracy activists have been arrested, silenced or forced into exile. Dozens of civil society groups have been disbanded, and outspoken media outlets like Apple Daily and Stand News have been shut down.  The draft text will be written later based on input from public consultation, which will begin Tuesday and will end Feb. 28. But the city released a 110-page document Tuesday outlining its plans for the legislation.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  City leader John Lee called the legislation a “constitutional responsibility.”  “We shouldn’t wait any longer,” he said during a news conference. “The threats to national security, they are real. We have experienced all these threats. We have suffered from them badly.”  Both the Hong Kong and Beijing governments have hailed the previous National Security Law for restoring stability after the massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.  Lee said a local version is still necessary to keep Hong Kong safe against “potential sabotage” and “undercurrents that try to create troubles,” in particular lurking ideas about Hong Kong independence. Lee also said that some foreign agents may still be active in Hong Kong.  He said other countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Singapore, have similar laws to safeguard security and Hong Kong would draw from them.  Critics worry authorities will use a domestic national security law as another tool to crack down on dissidents, further eroding freedoms that were promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  The Beijing-imposed security law criminalized subversion, advocating secession, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs as well as terrorism, but did not cover all the offenses authorities wanted to target.  Eric Lai, a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said that the one-month public consultation was shorter than the three months typical for important laws, saying it appeared to be “window dressing.”  Amnesty International’s China director, Sarah Brooks, said the proposed legislation could further entrench repression in the financial hub.  “This is potentially the most dangerous moment for human rights in Hong Kong since the introduction of the National Security Law in 2020,"" she said.  Highlights of the package include a ban on “threatening national security by collaborating with external forces to interfere in the affairs of our country or the HKSAR through improper means.” The document also suggested that colluding with an ""external force"" to publish a misleading statement with the intent of endangering national security could be considered an espionage offence.  It also bans inciting public officials to abandon the Basic Law or their allegiance to Hong Kong and China, expanding an existing law that only covered members of the police and other security forces.  Lee promised that people could still criticize the Hong Kong government and express opinions, as long as they do not intend to endanger national security.  The government has already muzzled most dissent using existing laws. Hundreds of people have been arrested under the 2020 law.  Some 47 people were charged under it for participating in an unofficial primary election, and two were convicted during the same time under an older sedition law for clapping in court and insulting a judge during a trial.  Lee said that the law will not provide for suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trial, unlike the 2020 law.  Security chief Chris Tang said the legislation would cover the use of computers and electronic systems to endanger national security, as well as disclosing state secrets and espionage, treason and sedition. The proposal includes an expanded definition of state secrets that covers the “economic and social development of Hong Kong,” as well as defense and diplomatic activities.  The leader of the city’s largest pro-democracy party called for clarification about how the law will define state secrets. Democratic Party Chairman Lo Kin-hei asked if journalists could be liable when reporting on inside information from the government in the public interest.  The proposal also seeks to revise and update several existing laws covering treason, theft of state secrets and espionage. Parts of the proposed law are to be applied beyond Hong Kong’s borders.  The government suggested it may use the new law to cancel the passports of fugitives overseas, citing a similar U.S. law.  Such laws could affect the many activists who went into exile fearing arrest. The Hong Kong police have offered bounties of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,000) on at least 13 activists abroad, including former lawmakers Nathan Law and Ted Hui, whom they accuse of colluding with external forces to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.  The new law could also make it harder for civil society groups to operate in Hong Kong. The city's security chief would gain new powers to shut down such organizations in order to safeguard security.  Following the consultation period, the proposed legislation will be drafted as a bill that will be scrutinized by the Legislative Council. Once the proposed law reaches the legislature, lawmakers are expected to pass the domestic national security law without much opposition in the three readings given a lack of opposition lawmakers following an overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system.  Lee did not give a timeline for enacting the law, other than that it should be done “as soon as possible.”  Under Hong Kong's constitution, the city is required to enact laws “on its own” to prohibit seven types of acts: treason, secession, sedition, subversion against China's central government, theft of state secrets, foreign political organizations conducting political activities in the city, and local political organizations establishing ties with foreign political groups.  ___  Soo reported from Singapore.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","Hong Kong Begins Work on Its Own National Security Law, Years After a Similar Law Crushed Dissent",14 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
6,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-01-30/illinois-election-board-to-consider-whether-to-boot-trump-from-ballot-over-insurrection-amendment,"CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois’ election board on Tuesday kept former President Donald Trump on the state’s primary ballot, a week before the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualifies him from the presidency.  The board’s unanimous ruling comes after its hearing officer, a retired judge and Republican, found that a “preponderance of the evidence” shows Trump is ineligible to run for president because he violated a constitutional ban on those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. But the hearing officer recommended the board let the courts make the ultimate decision.  The eight-member board, composed of four Democrats and four Republicans, agreed with a recommendation from its lawyer to let Trump remain on the ballot by determining it didn't have the authority to determine whether he violated the U.S. Constitution.  Board member Catherine McCrory prefaced her vote with a statement: “I want it to be clear that this Republican believes that there was an insurrection on Jan. 6. There’s no doubt in my mind that he manipulated, instigated, aided and abetted an insurrection on Jan. 6.”  But McCrory said she agreed the board doesn't have jurisdiction to enforce that conclusion.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Trump's attorney urged the board not to get involved, contending the former president never engaged in insurrection but that wasn't something it could determine. “We would recommend and urge the board to not wade into this,” attorney Adam Merrill said.  Trump cheered the decision in a post on his social media network, Truth Social. “The VOTE was 8-0 in favor of keeping your favorite President (ME!), on the Ballot,” Trump wrote.  An attorney for the voters who objected to Trump's presence on the ballot said they'd appeal to Cook County circuit court. “What’s happened here is an avoidance of a hot potato issue,” attorney Matthew Piers told reporters after the hearing. “I get the desire to do it, but the law doesn’t allow you to duck.”  The issue will likely be decided at a higher court, with the U.S. Supreme Court scheduled next week to hear arguments in Trump’s appeal of a Colorado ruling declaring him ineligible for the presidency in that state.  The nation’s highest court has never ruled on a case involving Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was adopted in 1868 to prevent former confederates from returning to office after the Civil War but has rarely been used since then. Some legal scholars say the post-Civil War clause applies to Trump for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and encouraging his backers to storm the U.S. Capitol after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.  Dozens of cases have been filed around the country seeking to bar Trump from the presidency under Section 3. The Colorado case is the only one that succeeded in court. Most other courts and election officials have ducked the issue on similar grounds to Illinois, contending they don't have jurisdiction to rule on the obscure constitutional issue.  Maine’s Democratic Secretary of State also ruled that Trump violated the 14th Amendment and is no longer eligible for the White House, but her ruling is on hold until the Supreme Court issues a decision.  Trump's critics argue he's disqualified by the plain language of Section 3, which forbids those who swore an oath to “support” the Constitution, then “engaged in insurrection” against it from holding office. They contend the former president is ineligible just as if he didn't meet the constitutional threshold of being at least 35 years old.  But Trump's attorneys have argued that the provision is vague and unclear and that Jan. 6 doesn't meet the legal definition of an insurrection. Even if it did, they argue, that Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment and isn't liable for what occurred and that the bar on office shouldn't apply to presidents.  Though Trump himself has blamed President Biden for the lawsuits because several have been filed by liberal nonprofits, there's no evidence the president was involved. On Tuesday, before the Illinois ruling, Biden said he didn’t have a problem with Trump being on presidential ballots. Biden said that in response to a reporter’s question before flying to Florida for campaign fundraising.  Section 3 was heavily used immediately after the Civil War, but after Congress granted an amnesty to most former Confederates in 1872 it fell into disuse. Legal scholars can only find one example of it being deployed in the 20th century — against a socialist who was not seated in congress because he objected to U.S. involvement in World War One — and only used a handful of times since Jan. 6.  The Illinois board members ducked the issue by concluding that, under state law, all they can do is assess whether the basic paperwork candidates fill out is true. The only way to remove Trump would be by concluding he made a false statement when he swore under oath in that paperwork that he was eligible for the office he sought.  Board member Jack Vrett, a Republican, warned that would create a dangerous precedent, given the dozens of election boards in the state that follow the main one's lead. “If we allowed them to say, ‘Don’t just look at the papers, look at the underlying allegations,’ that would open a floodgate,” Vrett said.  “Every possible school board candidate would seek to challenge the qualification” of their rival, Vrett added, “based on some alleged criminal conduct.”  ___  Riccardi reported from Denver.

7,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/after-two-year-hiatus-northern-irish-government-could-return-in-days,"By Amanda Ferguson  BELFAST (Reuters) -Northern Irish and British politicians voiced optimism on Tuesday that the regional power-sharing government could be restored quickly following a breakthrough overnight, ending a near two-year crisis that threatened a key part of the 1998 peace deal.  After months of negotiations, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the party had endorsed proposals agreed with London on post-Brexit trade rules to end its boycott of the government which it quit in February 2022.  The DUP, the region's largest pro-British party, had argued that London's Brexit deal with the European Union undermined Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom by demanding checks on some goods coming from Britain.  But London's offer to cement Northern Ireland's position in the UK in law, plus a 3.3 billion pound ($4.2 billion) financial package, looked set to win over the DUP.  All sides want to move quickly before critics unpick the proposals and imperil the restoration of regional government, a key part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to end decades of sectarian violence.  Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio Ulster the government could be restored within days ""if the (UK) government moves with the speed that I believe they can"".  He said the legislation would have two elements; one designed to affirm Northern Ireland's place within the UK and the other amending the UK Internal Market Act to ""protect the region's ability to trade with the rest of the UK"".  ""Have we achieved everything that we wanted to achieve?"" he asked. ""No, we haven't. I will be honest with people about what we've been able to deliver.""  Chris Heaton-Harris, Britain's Northern Ireland minister, said he looked forward to ""the restoration of the institutions of (the Northern Ireland Assembly) Stormont as soon as possible"".  He declined to offer any detail on the deal. If finalised in Northern Irish party talks later on Tuesday, the proposals will be published on Wednesday.  The three other parties set to form a new executive - Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party - broadly welcomed the developments and said they were ready to go back into government.  MUCH AT STAKE  London has kept its proposals under wraps to try to prevent them being undermined by hardened opponents of the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as both sides sought to end the impasse.  The two-year hiatus has put pressure on stretched public services and led to a budget deadlock with London. That triggered the biggest public sector strike in a generation this month after Northern Irish workers failed to receive pay increases given to others across the UK.  Steve Baker, a junior Northern Ireland minister, tried to pre-empt concerns that the changes might require Britain again to follow some EU regulations - which would infuriate advocates of Brexit.  ""There are no commitments of any kind ... to align GB (Great Britain) with EU law; prevent GB from diverging from any retained EU law; or increase alignment in Northern Ireland beyond the strictly limited scope parliament has approved,"" he said on X.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said his government and the European Commission still had to see the final deal to be confident it did not have any negative consequences for last year's reworked post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland or the Good Friday Agreement.  But following a ""good"" phone call with his British counterpart, Rishi Sunak, Varadkar told Ireland's parliament that he hoped a new government would be formed by Feb. 8.

8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/japan-pm-vows-to-do-everything-possible-to-boost-household-income,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Tuesday his government would do ""everything possible"" to achieve real income growth to put a decisive end to deflation.  ""The biggest mission for my administration is to revive the economy,"" Kishida told the lower house plenary in a policy speech marking the start of the regular parliament sessions.  ""The economy, particularly wage hikes, is an urgent issue.""  While he did not announce any new policies, the premier stressed the need to regain public trust in politics amid a funding scandal that has sent support for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to its lowest in more than a decade.  Achieving sustainable wage growth and stable inflation is a focus of this year's spring wage talks between employers and workers and could pave the way for the Bank of Japan to depart from its unconventional monetary stimulus.  Last year, Japan's blue chip firms offered a 3.6% wage hike, the highest in three decades, and economists now expect 2024 wage hikes could beat that at nearly 3.9%, reflecting a labour crunch and corporate cash pile of 343 trillion yen ($2.33 trillion).  However, small firms, which employ seven out of 10 workers, lag their larger peers in offering generous wage hikes.  Analysts are watching to see if there is any correlation between the end of deflation and the timing of the BOJ's policy change.  While Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, risks that price declines return have prevented authorities from declaring a decisive end to deflation.  Kishida said his administration has lifted minimum wages and sought to raise pay for public-sector workers in medical and welfare services as well as truck drivers, and the class of non-regular workers including part-timers and contract workers.  The premier said on top of wage hikes, temporary cuts in income and resident taxes of 40,000 yen ($269.96) per individual would be available from June, boosting disposable income.  ""By achieving rises in wages and disposable income through public and private-sector coordination, we will build a positive mindset in society that it's natural for wages to rise,"" he added.  Kishida and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki both stressed the need to tackle fiscal reform.  ""Japan's fiscal situation will become even more severe due to several rounds of extra stimulus budgets in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation,"" Suzuki told parliament.  He referred to planned issuance of government bonds (JGBs) of around 182 trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2025.  ""We must secure market confidence in Japan's fiscal sustainability by tackling fiscal reform in the medium to long term,"" Suzuki said. ""We will press ahead with expenditure and revenue reform with the aim of the primary budget surplus in fiscal 2025 by normalising spending structure.""

So much snow has fallen — so far, more than 8.7 feet (2.65 meters) — that roofs on commercial buildings are collapsing around Anchorage and officials are urging residents to break out their shovels to avoid a similar fate at home. As of Tuesday morning, the three-day storm had dropped nearly 17 more inches (43 centimeters) of snowfall, pushing Alaska's largest city past the 100-inch (254-centimeters) mark earlier than at any other time in its history.  The city is well on track to break its all-time record of 134.5 inches (342 centimeters).  Now, even winter-savvy Anchorage residents are getting fed up with the snow-filled streets and sidewalks, constant shoveling and six days of pandemic-era remote learning. It is already in the record books with this year’s snowfall, at eighth snowiest with a lot of time left this season.  “It’s miserable,” said Tamera Flores, an elementary school teacher shoveling her driveway on Monday, as the snow pile towered over her head. “It's a pandemic of snow.”  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Last year, 107.9 inches (274 centimeters) fell on Anchorage, making this only the second time the city has had back-to-back years of 100-plus inches (254-plus centimeters) of snow since the winters of 1954-55 and 1955-56.  This year, the roofs of three commercial structures collapsed under loads of heavy snow. On Tuesday, there were no injuries when a roof partially collapsed on a fourth warehouse building. The Anchorage Fire Department said in a statement the cause was under investigation but reminded residents of the importance of clearing snow off roofs. Last year, 16 buildings had roofs collapse, with one person killed at a gym.  The city last week issued guidance urging people to remove snow from their home roofs. Officials said there were snow loads of more than 30 pounds per square foot (146 kilograms per square meter).  “That is a lot of weight,” the notice said. It gave the example of a home with 1,500 square feet (139 square meters) of roof with 30 pounds per square foot (146 kilograms per square meter) of snow, which would be supporting about 45,000 pounds (20,411 kilograms), or ""about 8 full size light duty pickup trucks.”  Since it is so early in the season, people should think about removing the snow, especially if there are signs of structural distress. These include a sagging roof; creaking, popping, cracking or other strange noises coming from the roof, which can indicate its under stress from the snow; or sticking or jammed doors and windows, a sign the snow might be deforming the structure of the house.  Signs have popped up all over town from companies advertising services to remove the snow from roofs.  Anchorage isn't the only Alaska city beset by near-record snowfalls. So far this month, the capital city of Juneau had recorded 69.5 inches of snow. A storm could drop several inches of snow before the month ends, putting the monthly record of 75.2 inches (191 centimeters) set in 2009 at risk, said Andrew Park, a National Weather Service meteorologist.  But it was another type of storm that delayed Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy from delivering his State of the State address Monday in Juneau. Wind gusts topped out at 105 mph (169 kph) Monday at a ski resort on Douglas Island, across Gastineau Channel from Juneau. That disrupted flights, preventing department heads and guests from arriving.  Dunleavy was scheduled to give the speech a day later instead, and Park said there were no concerns over high winds Tuesday.  In Anchorage, some fun has come from a whole lot of snow.  The deluge of snowfall this year prompted one Anchorage homeowner to erect a three-tiered snowman standing over 20-feet- (6-meters-) tall. Snowzilla, as it’s named, has drawn people to snap photos.  Last week, Anchorage had below zero Fahrenheit (minus 17.7 Celsius) temperatures overnight for seven days, and it only snowed after it warmed up Sunday.  But Anchorage residents may not be able to hold on to the old adage that it’s too cold to snow.  Sunday’s snowfall was the first time since 1916 that over an inch of snow fell in Anchorage when temperatures were 2 degrees F (minus 16.6 C) or colder, said Kenna Mitchell, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.  And a return to bitter cold is likely what’s on tap later this week. An upper-level high pressure system could move back in, dropping temperatures back to below zero at night, possible as low as low as minus 25 F (minus 31..5 C) Thursday and Friday nights, said Michael Kutz, another weather service meteorologist.  “This winter is definitely rough. But us Alaskans are definitely built different,” resident Damon Fitts said as he shoveled the driveway at his residence.  “We can handle 100 inches of snow and still make it to work on time,” he said. “We can put up with a lot.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",'Pandemic of Snow' in Anchorage Sets a Record for the Earliest Arrival of 100 Inches of Snow,18 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

Officials said there were snow loads of more than 30 pounds per square foot (146 kilograms per square meter).  “That is a lot of weight,” the notice said. It gave the example of a home with 1,500 square feet (139 square meters) of roof with 30 pounds per square foot (146 kilograms per square meter) of snow, which would be supporting about 45,000 pounds (20,411 kilograms), or ""about 8 full size light duty pickup trucks.”  Since it is so early in the season, people should think about removing the snow, especially if there are signs of structural distress. These include a sagging roof; creaking, popping, cracking or other strange noises coming from the roof, which can indicate its under stress from the snow; or sticking or jammed doors and windows, a sign the snow might be deforming the structure of the house.  Signs have popped up all over town from companies advertising services to remove the snow from roofs.  Anchorage isn't the only Alaska city beset by near-record snowfalls. So far this month, the capital city of Juneau had recorded 69.5 inches of snow. A storm could drop several inches of snow before the month ends, putting the monthly record of 75.2 inches (191 centimeters) set in 2009 at risk, said Andrew Park, a National Weather Service meteorologist.  But it was another type of storm that delayed Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy from delivering his State of the State address Monday in Juneau. Wind gusts topped out at 105 mph (169 kph) Monday at a ski resort on Douglas Island, across Gastineau Channel from Juneau. That disrupted flights, preventing department heads and guests from arriving.  Dunleavy was scheduled to give the speech a day later instead, and Park said there were no concerns over high winds Tuesday.  In Anchorage, some fun has come from a whole lot of snow.  The deluge of snowfall this year prompted one Anchorage homeowner to erect a three-tiered snowman standing over 20-feet- (6-meters-) tall. Snowzilla, as it’s named, has drawn people to snap photos.  Last week, Anchorage had below zero Fahrenheit (minus 17.7 Celsius) temperatures overnight for seven days, and it only snowed after it warmed up Sunday.  But Anchorage residents may not be able to hold on to the old adage that it’s too cold to snow.  Sunday’s snowfall was the first time since 1916 that over an inch of snow fell in Anchorage when temperatures were 2 degrees F (minus 16.6 C) or colder, said Kenna Mitchell, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.  And a return to bitter cold is likely what’s on tap later this week. An upper-level high pressure system could move back in, dropping temperatures back to below zero at night, possible as low as low as minus 25 F (minus 31..5 C) Thursday and Friday nights, said Michael Kutz, another weather service meteorologist.  “This winter is definitely rough. But us Alaskans are definitely built different,” resident Damon Fitts said as he shoveled the driveway at his residence.  “We can handle 100 inches of snow and still make it to work on time,” he said. “We can put up with a lot.”",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",'Pandemic of Snow' in Anchorage Sets a Record for the Earliest Arrival of 100 Inches of Snow,18 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

The special court found Khan, 71, guilty of making public the contents of a secret cable from Pakistan's ambassador in Washington to the Islamabad government, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said. Former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was also sentenced to 10 years in the same case.  Khan was previously sentenced to three years in a corruption case in August, which had already ruled him out of the Feb. 8 election.  The court is likely to issue a written verdict within a day or two. Khan's PTI party said it would challenge the ruling.  ""We don't accept this illegal decision,"" Khan's lawyer, Naeem Panjutha, posted on social media platform X.  The PTI has not called for protests or demonstrations before the election. A bomb in Pakistan's Balochistan region killed three PTI members on Tuesday, the party said, hours after Khan was sentenced. There were no details of who was responsible.  Khan aide Zulfikar Bukhari told Reuters the legal team was given no chance to represent Khan or to cross examine witnesses. The proceedings were carried out in the maximum-security Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.  Another of Khan's lawyers, Ali Zafar, told ARY television that given the circumstances of the trial and sentencing, the chances of the case being quashed on appeal were ""100%"".  Bukhari called the conviction an attempt to weaken support for Khan. ""People will now make sure they come out and vote in larger numbers,"" he told Reuters.  Khan's legal team was hoping to get him released from jail, where he has been since August last year, but the latest conviction means that is unlikely even as the charges are contested in a higher court.  The party of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Khan's main political opponent, said the verdict was not harsh enough.  ""I think, based on his carelessness and crime - pertaining to important national interests - this is a very light sentence,"" Ahsan Iqbal, a senior Sharif aide, said in a TV interview.  MULTIPLE CASES  Analysts believe Sharif's party is the frontrunner to form the next government. Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, were convicted and jailed over graft allegations days before the last general election in 2018. Analysts say that that helped Khan win, while Khan's sentence now helps Sharif. Both blame the military.  Khan's sentencing just before the polls will ""raise questions about the election's credibility"", said Mazhar Abbas, a Karachi-based analyst.  Pakistan's recovery from an economic crisis depends on political stability. The election comes as Pakistan is navigating a tricky recovery path under a $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout that helped it narrowly avert a sovereign default last year.  Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022.  He says the secret cable mentioned in the case was proof of a conspiracy by the Pakistani military and the U.S. government to topple his government in 2022 after he visited Moscow, just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Washington and the Pakistan military deny the accusations.  Khan has previously said the contents of the cable appeared in the media from other sources.  In Washington on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it had no comment on Khan's jailing, with spokesperson Matthew Miller telling a regular briefing that it was matter for Pakistan's courts.  Khan's PTI suffered a major setback this month when a court upheld an Election Commission decision to strip it of its traditional election symbol, the cricket bat.  His candidates are now contesting as independents, many of them on the run, amid what the party calls a crackdown backed by the military. The military denies this.  Khan's media team posted a message from the jailed leader on X ahead of the verdict.  ""These people want to provoke you by giving me a harsh sentence in this case so that you go out on the streets and protest, then add unknown people to the crowd and then do another false flag operation,"" the post said.  In May last year, the first time Khan was arrested, his supporters were accused of rioting, and hundreds were arrested and tried. Khan denies his supporters were part of the mob.  Khan urged his supporters to vote for candidates backed by him. ""This is your war and this is your test that you have to take revenge for every injustice by your vote on February 8 while remaining peaceful,"" the post on X said.

2,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/kremlin-says-it-does-not-accept-valieva-doping-ban,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Tuesday it would appeal a decision to strip it of an Olympic gold medal after the Kremlin condemned a doping ban against teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva as politically motivated.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday banned Valieva for four years for doping, effective from December 2021, a decision that also stripped the Russian Olympic Committee's gold medal in the team event at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games nearly two years after the competition.  ""We do not agree with these decisions - neither with the decision of the court, nor with the decision of the (ice skating) federation. We don't accept them,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, a day after he described the CAS ruling as political.  ""If there are any opportunities to challenge and continue to defend the rights of our athletes, they must be mobilised to the end.""  Following Peskov's comments, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said its lawyers were preparing to contest the revision of the standings in the team event by the International Skating Union (ISU) that leave Russia without a gold medal but with bronze instead.  ""We base ourselves on the fact that, in accordance with the current applicable ISU rules, the consequences of sanctions against an individual athlete, in this case Kamila Valieva, cannot serve as the basis for revising the results of the team event,"" ROC said.  REVISED RESULTS  Valieva tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, which prevents angina, at the Russian national championships in December 2021. The result was made known only after she competed in the team event in Beijing.  Her team has said the positive test could have been due to a mix-up with her grandfather's heart medication.  But the CAS panel determined there had been no scope for Valieva, who was 15 at the time of the offence, to be treated with more leniency than an adult found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation.  In its revision of the Beijing results, the ISU demoted the Russian figure skating team from gold to bronze after Valieva's disqualification.  It was assumed that Canada, who finished fourth, would be promoted to bronze, but the ROC's total score even after Valieva's marks were erased was still a point better than the Canadians, the ISU announced.  The doping charge against the young athlete stirred strong emotions in Russia at the time.  Russia, and before it the Soviet Union, have long regarded the Olympics as a chance to showcase the country as a winner on the global stage. But doping controversies in the past decade have soured Moscow's relations with the International Olympic Committee and forced its athletes to compete at successive Games without their national flag or anthem.  ""Upon our return from China from the Olympics, we honoured these athletes as Olympic champions,"" Peskov said of Valieva and her team mates.  ""We are convinced that for us they will always remain Olympic champions, no matter what decisions are made in this regard, even unfair ones.""

3,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-30/bolton-excoriates-trump-in-fresh-introduction-to-his-memoir,"By Arshad Mohammed and Steve Holland  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton excoriated former President Donald Trump as an utterly self-interested man who would punish personal enemies and appease adversaries Russia and China in a new edition of his memoir released on Tuesday.  Bolton, who served in Trump's White House in 2018 and 2019, accused the Republican presidential frontrunner of having no political philosophy or coherent policy outlook. If re-elected, Trump could leave the NATO security alliance, curb support to Ukraine despite Russia's 2022 invasion, embolden China to blockade Taiwan and generally pursue isolationism, Bolton warned.  ""Trump is unfit to be president,"" Bolton wrote in the new foreword to ""The Room Where it Happened,"" his account of the 17 months he spent as Trump's national security adviser. ""If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse.""  While Trump casts himself as the underdog's champion, once saying ""for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,"" Bolton argues he is fundamentally self-regarding.  ""Trump really cares only about retribution for himself, and it will consume much of a second term,"" he wrote in the forward to the paperback edition of his memoir, which painted a bleak picture of America during a second Trump term.  Trump senior advisor Jason Miller said: “For someone who professes to have such great disdain for President Trump, ‘Book Deal Bolton’ sure has found a way to grift off the relationship"".  Bolton said before serving Trump he mistakenly believed the burdens of office would discipline the president. In the event, he found the former president consumed by self-interest.  ""He cares almost exclusively about his own interests,"" Bolton writes, suggesting Trump would want to be surrounded by ""a White House of serfs"" to execute his orders unquestioningly.  He also makes a case that Trump, revered by the right for appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized women's constitutional right to abortion, may not pursue conservative policies if re-elected.  Bolton said Trump's inability to run for a third term under the U.S. Constitution means ""the political constraints around him are much looser, and the real 'guardrail' of voter opinion will be minimized.""  Bolton saves some of his harshest words for foreign policy, writing Trump sent an ""isolationist virus"" coursing through the Republican party and that ""in no arena ... has the Trump aberration been more destructive than in national security.""  He also argued Trump could withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a prospect likely to please Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding that ""it is almost inevitable that a second-term Trump policy on Ukraine will favor Moscow.""  Taiwan and others along China's periphery ""face real peril in a second Trump term,"" Bolton adds, suggesting that the risks of China under President Xi Jinping manufacturing a crisis over Taiwan - perhaps by blockading the island - would rise.  ""It is a close contest between Putin and Xi Jinping who would be happiest to see Trump back in office,"" he writes.

4,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-29/bayer-faces-australian-test-with-judge-to-decide-whether-weedkiller-caused-cancer,"By Peter Hobson  CANBERRA (Reuters) - An Australian court on Tuesday heard closing arguments in a class action lawsuit alleging that a weedkiller produced by Bayer caused cancer, the first such case in Australia to reach this stage.  Bayer has already paid billions of dollars to settle claims that exposure to its glyphosate herbicide, Roundup, damaged health, in most cases by causing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer.  The company faces more than 50,000 claims in the United States, with the latest ruling requiring it to pay $2.25 billion to a single Pennsylvania man and driving its share price down.  The Australian lawsuit is one of relatively few outside the United States and is a test case for the country, where Roundup is widely used. It is against subsidiaries of Bayer and brings together more than 1,000 claimants.  If the judge at the Federal Court in Victoria rules in the coming months that Roundup caused lymphoma, the court will then consider whether Bayer was negligent regarding the risks its products posed and should pay damages.  Bayer says Roundup and glyphosate are safe. It said it ""fully stands behind its glyphosate-based products, which have been used around the world for almost 50 years.""  Damages are likely to be smaller than in the United States, a spokesperson for Maurice Blackburn, the firm representing the claimants, said. But a Maurice Blackburn lawyer has said each person should get a ""significant"" sum.  The lead claimant is 41-year-old Kelvin McNickle, who says he used Roundup to spray weeds for over two decades on his family's property and while working for a vegetation management company. He developed lymphoma aged 35.  His lymphoma recurred shortly before the trial began and he is currently undergoing treatment, Maurice Blackburn said.  Four other cases have been filed in Australia. Three have been permanently stayed by the Federal court and the fourth, another class action, has been paused pending the outcome of the McNickle claim, Bayer said.  MONSANTO  Roundup was originally produced by U.S. agrochemical company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018.  The product has been under scrutiny since the World Health Organization's cancer research agency concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans, though without concluding whether it posed a risk in real world use.  Bayer agreed in 2020 to pay up to $9.6 billion to settle ongoing Roundup lawsuits in the United States but did not get court approval for an agreement to prevent future cases.  Bayer said in its most recent annual report that it faced 31 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup, including 11 seeking class action certification. It did not mention any other claims outside the United States.  The company has been phasing out sales of the household version of Roundup but continues to sell glyphosate-based weedkillers to farmers, who rely on it heavily.  Regulators including in the United States continue to allow Roundup to be used, with the European Commission last year renewing glyphosate's approval for another 10 years.  Bayer has a mixed record defending its product in U.S. courts, winning 10 of the last 16 Roundup trials.

A back injury may have knocked him out for a while, but it sure hasn't slowed Simmons down.  Simmons had 10 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, Mikal Bridges added 33 points and the Nets routed the Utah Jazz 147-114 on Monday night.  Simmons hadn't played since Nov. 6 because of a pinched nerve in his lower back. The No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft played 18 minutes off the bench, made all five shots and likely would have had a triple-double if not for a minutes restriction.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The Nets outscored the Jazz by 27 points while Simmons was on the floor. He didn't commit a turnover.  “I just think his ability to pass is something that really elevates this team consistently,” teammate Lonnie Walker IV said.  Cam Thomas added 25 points for the Nets, who rolled to the highest point total they've ever scored at home in a regulation game, had 41 assists on their 54 field goals and made 21 3-pointers. They have won two straight games after losing seven of their previous eight.  Walker finished with 19 points as one of eight Nets in double figures. He and Royce O'Neale checked in along with Simmons midway through the first quarter and the game went exactly as Simmons told them it would.  “I told them as soon as we checked in, like, they know what time it is,” Simmons said.  Keyonte George scored 21 points for the Jazz, who had won two straight. They were trying to match an NBA record by scoring 120 points for a 12th straight game, but didn't help their chances by committing 17 turnovers that the Nets turned into 27 points.  “We just got outworked tonight,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “Plain and simple.”  Simmons checked in with 6:27 remaining in the first quarter, had his first assist six seconds later, assisted on four straight Nets baskets later in the period and had six assists in under five minutes of the quarter. Brooklyn led 43-28 after one, outscoring Utah by 12 when Simmons was in.  Simmons has battled back problems since coming to Brooklyn nearly two years ago, but looked like the player who was an All-Star in Philadelphia before that.  “I think certain guys know what it’s like to play with me and where their shots are going to come from, so for us it’s easy,” Simmons said.  The Nets went ahead 69-48 on Thomas’ 3-pointer with 2:36 remaining in the half, before the Jazz closed with a 9-2 spurt to cut it to 71-57 at the break.  Utah cut it to 11 late with 1 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter, but the Nets had it back up to 104-87 when the period ended after Walker tossed in a running 3-pointer at the buzzer.  Bridges then opened the fourth with consecutive 3-pointers to make it 110-87 and the Nets led by 35 later in the period.

Great job by both coaches.

The teams split four meetings this season.  “It’s why we play the game,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “You play to play the best teams in the league. You wake up for games like that. You really get to test yourself and see where you are. It was a dogfight tonight.”  Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren, one of the NBA's top rookies, finished with just four points on 2-for-9 shooting in 32 minutes.  “We did a good job of defending him and just made him take tough shots, and I could see it for him, you know, he was trying to get his teammates open, so he was just playing team basketball,"" Towns said.  The Thunder led 97-96 with 2:43 remaining before Minnesota took control. A two-handed dunk by Edwards down the middle of the lane in traffic put the Timberwolves up 101-97, and Minnesota led by at least four the rest of the way.  The Timberwolves won despite point guard Mike Conley sitting out his second straight game with a sore left hamstring.  “We really did a good job of finishing this game, which we haven’t been doing,"" Finch said. ""So hopefully it’s a good step and we can build on that part of it.”  Minnesota led 49-47 at halftime behind 13 points apiece from Edwards and Towns.  Edwards hit a 3-pointer two minutes into the second half to put the Timberwolves up 56-47.  The Thunder rallied, and a dunk by Williams gave them a 63-62 edge midway through the third quarter. Williams' 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left in the third put Oklahoma City up 77-73. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 12 points in the period.  In the end, the young Thunder, with many players still adjusting to the length of the season, struggled on the second night of a back-to-back and their third game in four days.  “It’s hard just getting adjusted to,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said.

(AP) — Two Michigan House districts will hold special election primaries on Tuesday to fill seats that were held by Democrats whose departures have left the legislative chamber in an even split since November.  Six candidates are running in each of the Detroit-area districts. Both the 13th and 25th districts have historically voted Democratic and the candidate who secures the Democratic nomination is expected to be the frontrunner in the April 16 general election.  Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has endorsed fellow Democrats Mai Xiong in the 13th District and Andrea Rutkowski in the 25th.  The seats were vacated in November after Democratic state Reps. Lori Stone and Kevin Coleman won mayoral races in their hometowns. That eliminated the Democrats' two-seat majority in the state House and put the chamber in a 54-54 deadlock.  The House deadlock follows a year in which Democrats pushed through a number of key pieces of legislation after flipping both chambers in the Legislature while holding onto the governor’s office in last year’s midterms.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  There has been minimal voting activity in the Legislature since the 2024 session began on Jan. 10.  The April winner in each district will serve the remainder of the term, through the end of this year. The entire Michigan House will be up for election in November's general election.  In addition to Xiong, who is a Macomb County commissioner, Suzanne Ostosh and former state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III are running in the 13th District's Democratic primary. Curtiss Ostosh, Brandon Cumbee and Ronald Singer are competing for the Republican nomination.

First, there are concerns about the campaign itself, where candidates are likely to talk tough on China. That could threaten the fragile improvements in U.S.-China relations seen in recent months.  Then there’s the outcome of the November vote. Neither candidate is particularly appealing to Beijing. While Biden has looked for areas of cooperation with China, Beijing is concerned about his efforts to unite allies in the Indo-Pacific in a coalition against China. It’s also nervous about his approach to Taiwan after he has repeatedly said he would have U.S. troops defend it in a conflict with China.  Trump, with his isolationist approach to foreign policy, might be more hesitant to defend Taiwan. But nothing can be ruled out given his unpredictability and his tough rhetoric on China, which he blames for the COVID-19 outbreak that dogged the end of his term. He also could deepen a trade war that hasn’t eased since his presidency.  “For China, no matter who won the U.S. presidential election, they would be two ‘bowls of poison’,” said Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  Even with the slight improvement in relations, tensions remain high, particularly over Taiwan. The question of who is in the White House could have enormous consequences not only for U.S.-China relations but for peace in the Asia-Pacific region.  Zhao's views are echoed by a number of analysts in both countries, who suggest Beijing may find Biden the lesser of two evils for his steadiness over Trump's unpredictability but also point out that the Chinese government agonizes over Biden's success in building partnerships to counter China.  “No matter who takes office, it will not change the overall direction of America's strategic competition with China,” said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University. “China doesn't have any preference for who will win the presidential election because China has experience dealing with either of them for four years.”  In China's social media, many commentators appear to be favoring Trump, whom they see not only as a businessman up for a deal but also a disruptive force that undermines American democracy and U.S. global leadership to the benefit of Beijing. Trump's policies and remarks as president earned him the nickname of Chuan Jianguo, or “Trump, the (Chinese) nation builder,” an implication that he was helping Beijing.  Trump's recent accusation that Taiwan took the chip-making industry from the U.S. has been seen as a sign that Trump, a businessman at heart, may not be willing to defend the self-governed island that Beijing considers to be Chinese territory.  Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center, cautioned against nationalistic sentiments in China that could be at odds with government officials and elites. “With Trump, there is no floor to U.S.-China relations, and Trump poses great risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of a military conflict,"" Sun said, adding China in 2020 was convinced that Trump could attack Taiwan to win reelection.  “There might be some benefit associated with Trump’s potential to damage alliances and partnerships, shaking the world’s confidence in America’s leadership, but the benefit for China will not be able to offset the even more significant damage he would impose on the relationship with China,” she said.  Trump started off on the wrong foot with China when he took a congratulatory call on his 2016 election victory from the president of Taiwan, angering the government in Beijing, which opposes any official contact between Taiwan and foreign governments.  Relations appeared to get back on track in 2017, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April and, six months later, hosted the U.S. president in Beijing with a dinner at the Forbidden City, the former imperial palace.  But in 2018, Trump started a trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods, and the tariffs on both sides remain to this day.  The COVID-19 outbreak in China in 2020 pushed Trump’s relationship with the country to the point of no return. As the virus spread to the United States, he tried to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic by blaming China, drawing strong rebukes from Beijing.  When Biden and Trump squared off in 2020, U.S. intelligence agencies reported before the election that China viewed Trump as “unpredictable” and opposed his reelection. A subsequent assessment issued months after the election said that China ultimately had not interfered on either side and “considered but did not deploy” influence operations intended to affect the outcome.  Experts say the Chinese also are unlikely to interfere with the U.S. presidential election this year, partly because they are unwilling and partly because they have yet to build up the capabilities. If Beijing is to interfere, it is more likely to try to discredit U.S. democracy, amplify partisan discord, and undermine faith in the election process, they say.  Once elected, Biden kept his predecessor's China policy. Not only did he keep the tariffs but Biden also limited access by Chinese companies to advanced technologies, sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights violations and expanded restrictions on China-bound U.S. monies.  Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in 2022 called China the “most serious long-term challenge to the international order.”  Then in early 2023, tensions spiked again when the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon. It took months of diplomacy to set up a meeting between Biden and Xi that resulted in some modest agreements and a vow to stabilize relations.  Miles Yu, director of the China center at the Hudson Institute, said the U.S. has come to a bipartisan agreement on China, with the two parties sharing “pretty much the same China policy."" In response, China's ruling Communist Party has a new U.S. policy, he said.  “It doesn’t matter if it’s a black cat or a white cat, as long as it’s an American cat, it’s a bad cat,” Yu said, borrowing from the famous saying by China's reformist politician Deng Xiaoping that encouraged market reforms regardless of ideology.  But several experts expressed a guarded preference for Biden because of his steadiness, which they say Beijing may appreciate in managing the already-fraught relations.  “Trump is by nature volatile and cruel and is a person hard to be familiar with,” said Shi Yinhong, international relations professor at Renmin University of China. While Beijing can expect its relationship with Washington to stay the course if Biden is reelected, it may not wish to deal with Trump's hysteria toward China and possibly drastic changes if he returns to the White House, Shi said.  Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, said Beijing is more worried about Trump's hostility toward globalization than Biden's worldwide efforts to build alliances. “We don’t expect any one of them would be better for China, but the key (for China) is to continue its opening and reforms, and high-quality development,” Wang said.  But Shi Sushi, a veteran commentator in Beijing, said it is easier for China to handle Trump, who just wants to cut a deal, than Biden, who has a values-based approach to governing.  “Biden’s toughness is something few Chinese understand,” Shi said. “He is an establishment politician. He is a defender of American values. He is engaged in ‘friends-circle diplomacy’ to form a circle of friends that integrates the power of the West to (counter) China. From this point of view, I can bluntly say that Biden is more difficult to deal with.""  ___  Tang reported from Washington.

0,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-01-30/after-alabama-pioneers-nitrogen-gas-execution-ohio-may-be-poised-to-follow,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio’s Republican attorney general put his weight behind a legislative effort Tuesday to bring nitrogen gas executions to the state, joining what could be a national movement in pro-death penalty states to expand capital punishment on the heels of Alabama’s first use of the method last week.  Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have already authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, and many more are looking for new ways to execute people because the drugs used in lethal injections have become difficult to find.  Attorney General Dave Yost said adding nitrogen gas as an execution alternative in Ohio could end an unofficial death penalty moratorium that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared in 2020. The governor said at the time that lethal injection was “no longer an option” for Ohio because of difficulties finding drugs and repercussions the state could face from drugmakers if one of their pharmaceuticals was used in an execution. The state's last execution was in 2018.  “Saying that the law of Ohio should be thwarted because pharmaceutical companies don’t want to sell the chemicals is an abdication of the sovereignty of the state of Ohio, which still has this law on the books,” Yost said.  He was joined at a Tuesday news conference by Republican state Reps. Brian Stewart and Phil Plummer, who introduced a bill Tuesday to add the new method. Alabama used it for the first time Thursday, when convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was put to death with nitrogen gas administered through a face mask to deprive him of oxygen.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  The execution took about 22 minutes from the time between the opening and closing of curtains to the viewing room. Smith seemed to remain conscious for several minutes. For at least two minutes, he appeared to shake and writhe on the gurney, sometimes pulling against the restraints.  State officials in Alabama said the process was humane and effective, while critics called it cruel and experimental.  The Ohio bill would give condemned inmates a choice between lethal injection and nitrogen gas but would require their executions to go forward with nitrogen gas if lethal injection drugs are not available, Stewart said. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday endorsed the idea of using nitrogen gas only in cases when lethal injection is unavailable.  Yost said nitrogen gas is abundant and would be easy for the state to procure from the private sector. At least one private company, industrial gas distributor Airgas, has announced its opposition to supplying nitrogen for executions.  Yost, a former prosecutor and potential 2026 gubernatorial contender, said he is not concerned that the method has been used only once and that Smith appeared to struggle for several minutes as he died.  “It's important to recognize that Europe is already using this for assisted suicide,” he said.  While a 3-D printed pod that employs nitrogen gas, the Sarco capsule, has been privately used for that purpose in Switzerland, the device has not been approved for use by any Swiss agencies. The European Union and the United Nations' human rights office expressed regret over the Alabama execution on Friday.  Plummer, a former county sheriff, said lengthy delays are defeating part of the purpose of Ohio's death penalty law: “We need some closure for the victims in cases like these ones.”  Stewart criticized DeWine for delaying so many executions over pharmaceutical companies’ unwillingness to see their products used to put people to death. He noted that Florida and the federal government have continued administering lethal injections while Ohio’s unofficial pause has been in place.  Yost noted that the federal government had a stockpile of drugs, putting it in a potentially different position than Ohio.  Ohio's last execution was on July 18, 2018, when Robert Van Hook was put to death by lethal injection for killing a man he met in a Cincinnati bar in 1985. His was the 56th execution since 1999.  Amid the unofficial moratorium, bipartisan groups of lawmakers have repeatedly pushed bills to eliminate the state's death penalty, including one this session.  Ohio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio, who backs abolishing the death penalty, said she was appalled at the proposal. She called nitrogen gas “so unconscionable that veterinarians reject its use to euthanize animals.”  “There is no humane form of execution in 2024,” she said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that anyone would rush to the nearest camera to plead for the introduction of experimental methods to resume the barbaric practice.""  DeWine — who helped write the state's current law, enacted in 1981 — has stopped short of supporting a death penalty repeal. But, he has increasingly questioned the law's value because of the long delays that elapse between crime and punishment.  The governor told The Associated Press during a year-end interview last month that he was not prepared to announce whether he would support an outright repeal.  “I did make it clear a few years ago that we could not carry out executions in the state of Ohio under the current law,” he said. “There's been really no movement in the state Legislature to come up with a different way of execution.” He said that would have been “the logical thing,” if support were there for continuing the practice.  DeWine's spokesman, Dan Tierney, said the governor typically does not comment on pending legislation. Tierney noted that no death penalty-related legislation, whether for or against, has moved in recent years.  Ohio has 118 men and one woman on death row, according to the most recent state report.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Could Ohio Be the Next State to Use Nitrogen Gas in Executions?

The move comes as the Canadian government has been attempting to curb a surge in immigration of international students, which has been partly blamed for a shortage of rental units and a 7.7% rise in rents nationwide in December versus a year earlier.  Last week, the federal government announced an immediate, two-year cap on new international student permits, which will cut the country's intake by 35% this year to about 360,000. It will also stop giving work permits to some students after graduation.  As of the end of last year, there were about 1 million international study permit holders in Canada, an amount about three times larger than that of a decade ago, according to government data.  Canada has emerged as a popular destination for international students since it is relatively easy for them to obtain work permits after they finish courses.

3,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-29/vietnam-philippines-seal-deals-on-south-china-sea-security,"By Khanh Vu  HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam and the Philippines agreed on Tuesday to boost cooperation between their coastguards and to prevent untoward incidents in the South China Sea, in an announcement during a state visit to Hanoi by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.  The two Southeast Asian countries have competing claims over some parts of the South China Sea, a conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade that China claims almost in its entirety.  The two memoranda of understanding on security covered ""incident prevention in the South China Sea"" and ""maritime cooperation"" among coastguards, according to a Vietnamese official who announced the deals during a formal ceremony in the country's presidential palace.  The agreements in Hanoi could risk angering Beijing, especially if they paved the way for future compromises on disputed claims. China tends to view progress in the resolution of border disputes among other claimants with scepticism.  Both Hanoi and Manila have had run-ins with China's coastguard in the past, but altercations have been frequent in the last year between vessels of China and U.S.-ally the Philippines, adding strain to deteriorating relations.  The maritime cooperation deal aims to establish a comprehensive partnership between the two Coast Guards on capacity building, training, and personnel and ship exchanges to improve their ability to run operations together, according to Marcos' remarks at a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.  ""The South China Sea remains to be a point of contention,"" Marcos said at the meeting.  ""We are firm in defending our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction against any provocations. But at the same time, we are also seeking to address these issues with China through peaceful dialogue and consultations as two equal sovereign states.""  Before meeting Vietnam's President Vo Van Thuong, Marcos said Vietnam was ""the sole strategic partner of the Philippines"" in Southeast Asia and stressed that maritime cooperation was the foundation of that relationship.  ""The world and regional situation is evolving in a rapid and complicated manner and therefore we need to unite and cooperate more closely,"" Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said, noting Marcos' visit helped boost bilateral relations.  Vietnam, one of the world's biggest rice exporters, also sealed agreements with the Philippines, a top importer of the grain, covering rice trade and agriculture cooperation.  In his two-day visit to Hanoi, Marcos is meeting Vietnamese leaders, but not Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, according to official schedules, in what would be Trong's third consecutive absence from meetings with visiting leaders this month.  Trong, 79, however attended a parliament's session in mid-January, partly dispelling concerns about his health after he was not included in official schedules of visiting leaders from Laos and Indonesia.  Before meeting Vietnamese political leaders on Tuesday, Marcos met Pham Nhat Vuong, the head of Vingroup, Vietnam's largest conglomerate, on Monday.  The company said on Tuesday its electric car unit VinFast will open a business network in the Philippines.  Marcos said the Philippines could help produce batteries for electric vehicles, thanks to its reserves of cobalt, copper and nickel, Vingroup said in a statement.  He said the two countries aim to increase bilateral trade to $10 billion from $7 billion.

6,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-29/at-trendy-japanese-cafes-customers-enjoy-cuddling-with-pigs,"TOKYO (AP) — First there were cafés that allowed pets. Then came cat cafés, where lattes took second place to feline interaction. The latest craze in Japan: The pig café.  “It was wonderful. Very relaxing and enjoyable,” said Brad Loomis, a software engineer from Pullman, Washington, after visiting Tokyo’s Mipig Café with his 21-year-old daughter, Paige.  They were among dozens of customers on a recent morning, taking selfies and breaking into huge smiles. The pigs, a miniature breed, trotted about the room, looking for a cozy lap to cuddle up.  The pigs are surprisingly quiet, although they do snort now and then. They don’t like to be alone, making for great companionship. Unlike the stereotype, they're very clean and don’t smell.  Customers pay 2,200 yen ($15) for the first 30 minutes in the company of the pigs. A reservation is required.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  “Each pig is unique. Each one has his or her own personality. You may notice one may be strong-headed, and another may be gentle,” said Shiho Kitagawa, an executive at Mipig who refers to the pigs as “buta-san,” using an honorific.  The Mipig Café in fashionable Harajuku is among 10 such pig cafes the operator has opened around Japan. The first one opened in Tokyo in 2019. Two more are in the works for later this year.  The animals, known as “micro pigs,” don’t get bigger than a corgi dog, even as adults. The cafés also feature adorable baby pigs the size of toy poodles.  Pig lovers say they make great pets. They can be purchased for about 200,000 yen ($1,350) from Mipig, have already been toilet-trained and are used to being with people. Micro pig food is also for sale. Mipig says it has sold 1,300 pigs as pets.  A drink dispensing machine is in the corner of the café, but hardly anyone was bothering to get a drink, being too occupied with the pigs.  Foreign tourists visiting the café said they found out about it on Instagram and other social media. The café does not invest in advertising. They made sure to include a visit during their trip to Japan, along with the usual tourist spots like the ancient capital of Kyoto, they said.  Australian Ben Russell smiled when a pig finally climbed into his lap. Although this was his first encounter with a real pig, they have always been his favorite animal, he said, although he wasn’t sure exactly why.  Sophie Mo’unga from New Zealand, in Japan with her husband and two children, was a big hit with the pigs, with several of them fighting over her lap.  “They were cute. I think they were all keeping each other warm,” she said.  The pig café is the latest in a series of animal coffee shops that have popped up in Japan, including ones that feature owls, hedgehogs, birds and even snakes.  Some people have raised ethical questions about whether the animals enjoy the experience as much as the humans.  “It must be stressful to be touched and fondled by a bunch of strangers,” said Sachiko Azuma, head of Tokyo-based PEACE, which stands for Put an End to Animal Cruelty and Exploitation.  “The animals have become tools for a money-making business,” she said.  Her group mainly opposes animal experiments and “petting zoos.” Cafés tend to be tiny and don't provide enough of a natural environment for cats or small pigs, and those that entrap wildlife are abhorrent, Azuma said. She approves of cafés run by shelters trying to find owners for abandoned pets.  Dr. Bruce Kornreich, professor of clinical sciences at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, N.Y., said interacting with animals can lower one’s blood pressure and reduce headaches and the risk of cardiovascular disease. It also enhances a sense of well-being and helps people cope with stress, he said.  “How they do these things, I’m not sure we know the answer,” said Kornreich, who is also part of the Cornell Feline Health Center, which advocates the study and well-being of cats.  “There is mounting evidence that associating with and owning pets can provide mental health and physical health benefits for people,” he said in a Zoom interview.  Even with dogs, it’s not clear if it’s walking the dog that helps the owner’s health or being in the presence of a friendly animal.  Whatever it is, with dogs or pigs, people are soothed and happy.  “Very cute and very sleepy,” Paige Loomis said of the pigs. “They made me sleepy.”  ___  Yuri Kageyama is on X https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]","At Trendy Japanese Cafés, Customers Enjoy Cuddling With Pigs",21 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png

The investigation is continuing, and the board said it has not yet determined a probable cause for the close call.  The nighttime incident was among several close calls at U.S. airports that alarmed the public and lawmakers and led the Federal Aviation Administration to hold a “safety summit"" last year.  The pilots of the London-bound American Airlines Boeing 777 took a wrong turn on a taxiway alongside two perpendicular runways. The crew had first planned for a takeoff from runway 31L. However, they later got instructions from a controller and a message on their cockpit computer telling them to taxi across 31L and take off from runway 4L.  Political Cartoons View All 253 Images  In later interviews, “all three pilots (on the American Airlines plane) said they understood at that time that (the flight) would be departing runway 4L,” according to the NTSB.  Instead, they crossed 4L just as a Delta Boeing 737 began its takeoff roll down the same runway.  The captain, Michael Graber, said that as the plane crossed the middle of runway 4L, he saw red runway lights turn on — the lights warn pilots when it's not safe to be on the runway.  “All of a sudden I saw that red glow and I just — right away I said something — that ain’t right,” he told investigators. “I didn’t know what was happening, but I was thinking something’s wrong.”  The captain added power to speed across.  Graber told investigators that he heard and understood the directions from the controller but got distracted by a heavy workload and, in his mind, might have gone back to thinking they were taking off from the other runway.  The co-pilot, Traci Gonzalez, said she knew the entire time that they were supposed to cross runway 31L, “but she was unaware of the airplane’s position when the captain taxied onto runway 4L,” investigators wrote. “She knew they were approaching a runway, but she did not realize they were approaching runway 4L.”  The co-pilot also blamed distractions, including an unusually high number of weather alerts.  The third person in the cockpit, Jeffrey Wagner, a relief pilot for the long international flight, said he was “heads down” and didn’t know where the plane was as it taxied on to the runway. He said that when they crossed the wrong runway and he saw a plane to his right, he initially thought it might be taxiing behind them.  The Delta pilots, warned by the air traffic controller, were able to brake to a stop. The planes were never closer than about 1,000 feet (300 meters) apart — not a comforting margin in aviation-safety terms.  A controller warned the American crew about a “possible pilot deviation,"" and gave them a phone number to call, which the captain did. After a delay, they took off for London — this time on runway 31L. The crew did not report the incident to American Airlines before taking off.  The cockpit voice recording from inside the American plane was taped over during the six-hour flight to London and lost forever.  Investigators said they tried several times to interview the American pilots, but the pilots refused on advice of their union, which objected to the NTSB recording the interviews. The NTSB then took the highly unusual step of issuing a subpoena to compel the crew members to sit for recorded interviews.  The pilots’ union, the Allied Pilots Association, had no immediate comment Monday on the NTSB documents.  The report renewed recommendations that the Federal Aviation Administration require better preservation of cockpit voice recordings. They run on loops that typically tape over old sounds after two hours. The FAA finally bowed to NTSB pressure late last year, announcing that it would propose that recordings not be overwritten for 25 hours — but only on new planes.",,"[{'src': 'https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png', 'width': 92.0, 'height': 30.0, 'area': 2760.0}]",Investigators Detail How an American Airlines Jet Crossed a Runway in Front of a Delta Plane at JFK,23 hours ago,USA,https://www.usnews.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png
3,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-01-29/trump-lawyer-says-judges-possible-conflict-may-taint-83-million-carroll-verdict,"By Jonathan Stempel  NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for Donald Trump said on Monday a possible conflict of interest involving the judge who oversaw E. Jean Carroll's recent defamation trial may justify overturning the writer's $83.3 million award.  In a letter filed in federal court in Manhattan, the lawyer Alina Habba cited a Jan. 27 New York Post article discussing U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan's alleged prior working relationship with Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related.  Both worked about two years at the same time at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in the early 1990s, before Judge Kaplan was appointed to the federal bench in 1994.  The article quoted an unnamed former Paul Weiss partner who said Roberta Kaplan sought to distinguish herself, like all associates, and Judge Kaplan had been ""like her mentor.""  Habba said this ""particularly concerning"" matter could justify a new trial on liability and damages, which the judge's ""overtly hostile"" treatment of Trump's side and ""preferential"" treatment of Carroll's side could also support.  Trump plans to appeal last Friday's $83.3 million verdict, which stemmed from his June 2019 denials that he raped Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.  Judge Kaplan's chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours.  Spokespeople for Carroll and Roberta Kaplan did not immediately respond to similar requests, but one spokesperson told the Post that no conflict existed. Paul Weiss also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Habba's letter cited among other things the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges.  The code says judges shall disqualify themselves from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including when ""a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter.""  Carroll's $83.3 million verdict included $18.3 million of compensatory damages and $65 million of punitive damages.  A different jury last May awarded the former Elle magazine advice columnist $5 million, finding Trump liable for a similar October 2022 defamation and for sexual abuse.  Trump is appealing that verdict. The first jury's findings were binding for the second trial, leaving the jury there to focus only on damages.

7,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/texas-cyclist-killer-caught-yoga-ad-costa-rica,"US authorities have revealed that they captured the convicted killer of the professional cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson with a clever ruse: by placing an advertisement on social media purportedly seeking a yoga instructor, which in turn lured the fugitive out of hiding.  Investigators with the US Marshals Service came up with the ad idea while on an international manhunt for Kaitlin Armstrong, a former yoga instructor who had fled to Costa Rica after killing the 25-year-old Wilson in May 2022 in Austin, Texas, according to newly released information on the case reported on Sunday by the CBS News show 48 Hours.  Armstrong shot and killed Wilson on 11 May 2022 in what prosecutors described as an extreme act of jealousy. Wilson had briefly dated Armstrong’s boyfriend at the time, the cyclist Colin Strickland, after he and Armstrong had broken up.  The night Wilson was killed, she and Strickland had gone swimming together and had dinner. Strickland then dropped Wilson off at a friend’s house, where she had been staying to prepare for an upcoming bike race.  Soon after, Armstrong approached Wilson and shot her several times. A friend later discovered Wilson, who died while bleeding from multiple bullet wounds.  Armstrong evaded authorities for a month and a half by using her sister’s passport to fly to Costa Rica. She assumed several fake identities and underwent plastic surgery to change her appearance.  After intense but unsuccessful search efforts, officers received a tip that Armstrong could be living in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, a small beach town 93 miles (150km) outside the country’s capital, San José.  Authorities initially had difficulty spotting Armstrong in Santa Teresa, a popular travel destination, as many of those in the town physically resembled Armstrong.  “I think from the get-go we were told … you’re gonna be in for a surprise, ‘cause a lot of the women in Santa Teresa look just like Kaitlin – a lot of them,” the deputy US marshal Damien Fernandez said to CBS.  Investigators even enlisted a female operative to take local yoga classes with the hopes of spotting Armstrong, a yoga enthusiast. But police were unable to locate her.  In a last ditch effort, US investigators posted an advertisement looking for a yoga teacher on Facebook.  “Just saying, hey, we’re at this hostel, we’re looking for a yoga instructor as soon as possible. Please contact us at this number,” Fernandez told CBS of the advertisement.  After nearly a week of no responses, Armstrong reached out saying she was interested in the job.  Police arrested Armstrong after confirming she had indeed been the one to respond to the ad, and they extradited her back to Texas to face charges.  A jury in November convicted Armstrong of murder, and she was later sentenced to 90 years in prison.  Armstrong is serving her punishment in Lucille Plane state prison in Dayton, Texas, as the Washington Post reported.","US marshals lure fugitive killer of Texas cyclist out of hiding with yoga ad | Texas | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development More Kaitlin Armstrong leaves court in Austin after receiving a sentence of 90 years over the death of Anna ‘Mo’ Wilson.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/nikki-haley-swatted-republicans,"Nikki Haley was targeted by a second “swatting” attempt on New Year’s Day – just two days after authorities responded to a similar call regarding Haley, according to Reuters.  This time, the call was made by someone who said Haley’s daughter had been shot and was lying in a pool of blood. The caller, who told police her name was Rose, also said she was on the phone with Haley, who was threatening to shoot herself.  A Charleston county sheriff’s deputy responded to the scene and it was soon discovered the call was a hoax.  After the 2024 Republican presidential candidate and former governor of South Carolina confirmed, on NBC’s Meet the Press on Monday, that she had been the victim of a swatting hoax, new information from an incident report obtained by Reuters has revealed she was actually swatted on two separate occasions.  Police first responded to a swatting call – or a prank call intentionally made to lure resources such as a Swat team to a location to respond to a false threat of danger – at Haley’s home in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, on 30 December. Haley was not present at the time of the swatting, but her parents were home with a caregiver.  Haley’s son was also away from the home, as was her husband, Michael, who is serving overseas.  Haley called the ordeal an “awful situation”.  “It put the law enforcement officers in danger, it put my family in danger,” Haley said. “It was not a safe situation.”  “That’s what happens when you run for president,” Haley said. “What I don’t want is for my kids to live like this.”  According to an email including comments from Kiawah Island public safety, obtained by Reuters, authorities were called to Haley’s house after a man called 911 and “claimed to have shot his girlfriend and threatened to harm himself while at the residence of Nikki Haley”.  The 1 January incident marks the second swatting attempt against Haley.  Haley is now one of several high profile politicians targeted by swatting calls.  In December, the home of the Florida senator Rick Scott was also swatted. The homes of two other members of congress, the New York congressman Brandon Williams and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, were also swatted. Greene said on X that she had been a victim of a swatting call several times, including once on Christmas Day.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A judge in Donald Trump’s federal election subversion case was also targeted. Police responded to a report of a shooting at a Washington DC home revealed to belong to the US district judge Tanya Chutkan. Authorities quickly determined there was no threat of a shooting.

Photograph: Sean Rayford/SOPA Images/Rex/Shutterstock Nikki Haley Nikki Haley was swatted twice within days amid ‘spike’ in threats to officials Police responded to fake calls targeting Republican presidential candidate, along with several other high-profile politicians Erum Salam Tue 30 Jan 2024 01.03 GMT Last modified on Tue 30 Jan 2024 13.56 GMT Nikki Haley was targeted by a second “swatting” attempt on New Year’s Day – just two days after authorities responded to a similar call regarding Haley , according to Reuters. This time, the call was made by someone who said Haley’s daughter had been shot and was lying in a pool of blood. The caller, who told police her name was Rose, also said she was on the phone with Haley, who was threatening to shoot herself. A Charleston county sheriff’s deputy responded to the scene and it was soon discovered the call was a hoax. After the 2024 Republican presidential candidate and former governor of South Carolina confirmed, on NBC’s Meet the Press on Monday, that she had been the victim of a swatting hoax, new information from an incident report obtained by Reuters has revealed she was actually swatted on two separate occasions. Police first responded to a swatting call – or a prank call intentionally made to lure resources such as a Swat team to a location to respond to a false threat of danger – at Haley’s home in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, on 30 December. Haley was not present at the time of the swatting, but her parents were home with a caregiver. Haley’s son was also away from the home, as was her husband, Michael, who is serving overseas. Haley called the ordeal an “awful situation”. The search for Trump’s running mate: ‘like auditions for The Apprentice’ Read more “It put the law enforcement officers in danger, it put my family in danger,” Haley said. “It was not a safe situation.” “That’s what happens when you run for president,” Haley said. “What I don’t want is for my kids to live like this.” According to an email including comments from Kiawah Island public safety, obtained by Reuters, authorities were called to Haley’s house after a man called 911 and “claimed to have shot his girlfriend and threatened to harm himself while at the residence of Nikki Haley”. The 1 January incident marks the second swatting attempt against Haley. Haley is now one of several high profile politicians targeted by swatting calls. In December, the home of the Florida senator Rick Scott was also swatted. The homes of two other members of congress, the New York congressman Brandon Williams and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, were also swatted. Greene said on X that she had been a victim of a swatting call several times, including once on Christmas Day. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

7,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/nearly-9-per-cent-increase-of-firearms-crimes-in-canada-report-1.6748323,"Violent crimes involving a firearm in Canada are increasing, a new report by Statistics Canada suggests.  According to the agency, there was an 8.9 per cent increase in firearm-related violent crimes(opens in a new tab) per 100,000 people in 2022.  Advertisement  ""The 2022 rate of firearm-related violent crime is the highest since comparable data were first compiled in 2009,"" the report published on Tuesday reads.  StatCan is using the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey and the Homicide Survey for its analysis.  Ontario gun crimes part of the issue  The spike in firearm-related violent crimes in Canada in 2022 is driven by increases in Ontario, the report notes.  According to the data, police in the province reported 4,791 firearm violent crimes in 2022, which is 1,016 more than the previous year.  This accounts for 70 per cent of the increases in incidents across Canada.  Although StatCan says the crimes in Toronto were ""especially high"", almost all cities saw firearm-related violent crime increases.  The province's capital city saw a three-year decline in these crimes until 2022, the report notes, when 2,576 crimes were reported.  ""As a result, the 2022 rate (43.2 incidents per 100,000 population) was 36 per cent higher than in 2021,"" the report reads.  Greater Sudbury (65 per cent), Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo (53 per cent) and Brantford (39 per cent) also had ""bigger"" increases in firearm-related violent crimes, the data shows.  What province, territory has the highest gun crime?  Alberta and British Columbia also contributed to the increases in firearm crimes in Canada.

Edmonton had a crime rate increase of 22 per cent and Calgary saw a 5.1 per cent rise.  Comparing provinces, Saskatchewan continued to be the province with the highest rate of firearm-related violent crimes in 2022, despite the data showing a 7 per cent decrease from the year prior.

An example of this, StatCan notes, is the 141 per cent increase in these crimes in the Provincial North and 139 per cent increase in the territories.  During this time, southern urban areas had a 45 per cent increase, the agency says.  In this period, specific violent crimes, like discharging a firearm with intent, pointing a firearm and using a firearm during an offence, rose 120 per cent across Canada.  This jump is due to an increase in incidents of discharging a firearm with intent, which has more than tripled (244 per cent) from 2013 to 2022.  Crimes with all weapons types have risen, with handguns (50 per cent), rifles or shotguns (45 per cent) and fully automatic firearms (35 per cent) seeing double-digit increases.

The government will continue to pursue policies and put rules in place so that spectrum is put to use for the benefit of all Canadians. With these new measures, Canadians will benefit from better use of spectrum and improved connectivity in rural and remote areas. /Public Release.

2,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/what-experts-think-of-canada-suspending-funding-to-unrwa-over-oct-7-allegations-1.6747563,"Canada and 10 other nations announced this week they will suspend funding for UNRWA, a UN agency that supports Palestinians, after Israel alleged some of its staff played a role in the Hamas attack last October.  The director of the agency said it terminated the suspected staff, but warned on Monday that it won't be able to continue operations beyond February if support is not restored. Now, global affairs experts are worried Canada and the other nations' decision to pause funding could have grave consequences for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.  Advertisement  Yves Fortier, former Canadian ambassador to the UN, appeared on CTV News Channel on Monday to discuss Canada's decision and why he hopes it is only temporary.  ""There are bad apples in every basket,"" Fortier said in reference to the dozen UNRWA employees who are accused of aiding Hamas, in an agency with over more than 13,000 staff in the Gaza Strip.  ""I visited the agency's headquarters in Gaza Strip, they're doing a lot of good vis-à-vis Palestinians who need, particularly at this moment, assistance and food and water.""  Japan and Austria were the latest countries to suspend funding for the UN agency. The 11 countries taking part in the pausing of funds account for more than 60 per cent of UNRWA's funding, according to its website.  Global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw also appeared on CTV New Channel on Monday to discuss the updated list of nations pausing their funding, and how it can get worse for an organization that was already cash starved and underfunded.  ""Hospitals, schools, psychosocial centres, sanitation, road clearing: (UNRWA) is a municipal government over there,"" Bociurkiw said. ""With the big percentage of the Gaza Strip population on the verge of starvation, this is not something that other UN agencies can fill the gap.""  Michael Fakhri is the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. He said the situation is dire without these funds, as UNRWA has been the centre of civic life in the Gaza Strip and refugee camps throughout Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.  ""The key thing to remember is that it has operated in Gaza since 1950. Before the (Oct. 7 attacks), 1.2 million people relied on UNRWA for food assistance,"" Fakhri said on CTV News Channel Monday. ""Before I heard (countries pausing funding), I was raising the alarm that famine was imminent. Without these funds, famine might be inevitable in the next few weeks.""  On Monday, an Israeli document spelled out allegations against the dozen UN employees, claiming seven stormed into Israeli territory, including two who participated in abductions. The accusations come after years of tensions between Israel and the agency known as UNRWA over its work in Gaza, where it employs roughly 13,000 people.  Bociurkiw, a former communications chief in the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) East Jerusalem offices, said an interim solution needs to be found while an investigation runs its course, but the 11 countries' decision is very bad timing.  When asked if he thought the freezing of funds is temporary, Bociurkiw said nations like Canada and Italy will likely reconsider.  But if U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump is elected this coming November, one of his first acts would be to cut funding to UNRWA and other agencies active in the Gaza Strip like the World Health Organization.  Fortier, who briefly served as president of the UN Security Council in 1989, said he personally regrets that Canada has joined nations like the U.S., the U.K. and Germany in suspending its funding for UNRWA, believing any decision should be withheld until Israel's allegations have been investigated thoroughly.  ""This will only injure more Palestinians. There's been 26,000 Palestinians who have been killed since Oct. 7, so I believe countries should hold their fire until an investigation has been carried out, and the bad apples have been removed from the bushel.""  Fakhri said even before the Oct. 7 attacks, more than 50 per cent of Gaza residents were food insecure and there was a high degree of malnutrition, with residents only receiving the bare minimum of what humans need to be healthy. He said the response from the 11 countries is incredibly disproportionate.  ""I'm not sure why the alleged actions of 12 employees has led to such a massive retaliation against all Gazans and Palestinian refugees,"" Fakhri said. ""The response, in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, has been to defund the most effective and primary source of aid. That makes no sense.""

Photo by Sean Kilpatrick / The Canadian Press Article content OTTAWA – Global Affairs Canada is scrambling to investigate a major data breach caused by a month-long “malicious” compromise of an internal network that exposed the data and emails of numerous employees. In a series of notes sent to employees beginning Jan. 26 and obtained by National Post, GAC says it was the victim of a data breach when one of its Virtual Private Networks (VPN) — which Canada-based workers use to securely connect to GAC’s Ottawa headquarters — was “compromised” for over one month.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content Article content The VPN was likely compromised beginning on Dec. 20, but the breach was only discovered on Jan. 24, according to the memo. During that time, it appears hackers gained access to an undisclosed number of GAC employees’ emails as well as personal and shared servers on their laptops connected to the compromised VPN. “If you used a SIGNET (Secure Integrated Global Network) laptop between December 20th, 2023, to January 24th, 2024, to connect remotely (via VPN) to HQ GAC servers, you may be vulnerable. Email traffic and files on your H (personal) and I (shared) drives may have been compromised,” reads a memo sent to employees directly impacted by the breach. Global Affairs only advised the public of the major breach hours after the National Post sent the department a series of questions about the incident, which was discovered five days earlier. In a statement, the department confirmed that the breach was due to “malicious cyber activity.” In other words, it was a criminal hack. “Early results indicate there has been a data breach and that there has been unauthorized access to personal information of users including employees. The Department is contacting those affected with mitigation measures to ensure that sensitive and personal information is secure,” read the statement by spokesperson Marilyne Guèvremont.

Article content Global Affairs Canada did not respond to numerous questions about the breach, including why it took over one month to discover, how many employees are suspected to have been affected and what is has done to protect potentially compromised information. Internally, the government says it doesn’t yet know the scale of the breach nor the exact timeline and that it could discover more issues as the investigation alongside Shared Services Canada (SSC) — the government’s IT department that manages many VPN networks — and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) continues. “Forensic work … is ongoing to help us understand the impact on our networks and any potential changes in the scope and in the time frame of the data breach,” reads one internal memo. When it discovered the breach, GAC confirmed that it took down some internal systems, including the compromised VPN network, as the government investigates. Sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about the breach say employees were also asked to reset all their passwords and their encryption keys.

Article content “The Department’s critical services and external communication channels remain accessible and operational,” Guèvremont wrote. GAC also told its employees that it disclosed the breach to the Federal Privacy Commissioner last week “as required when a privacy breach of this nature occurs.” On its website, the commissioner says organizations need to disclose any “breaches of security safeguards involving personal information that pose a real risk of significant harm to individuals.” The commissioner’s office confirmed Tuesday that it had been notified of the breach and was probing the incident. Cybersecurity expert Steve Waterhouse said in an interview that a system being compromised for over one month is a “long time,” but the severity of the breach really depends on how much deep into GAC’s protected networks hackers managed to get. He also said there have been a few “zero-day vulnerabilities” in popular VPN hardware products that have come to light in the last month that could explain the breach. He said it’s time the government invest in programmers whose job is to look for vulnerabilities in their own systems so that departments can get a head start on discovering breaches and vulnerabilities.

Article content This is the second time in two years that GAC has suffered a significant cyber incident. In early 2022, a cyber attack caused by a still-unidentified foreign state actor caused a multi-day shutdown of numerous GAC internal systems. Many experts have since noted that breach had all the signs of a Russia-backed cyber threat actor, but the government has consistently refused to confirm that information.

7,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/us-assassination-plot-iranian-national-two-canadians-charged,"The US has charged an Iranian drug trafficker with intelligence ties to Tehran, a Canadian Hells Angel and another Canadian man in an alleged plot to carry out assassinations in the US.  According to statements by the justice department and the Treasury on Monday, the alleged drug smuggler Naji Sharifi Zindashti, ran an assassination ring on behalf of Iran’s ministry of intelligence and security (Mois).  The indictment against Zindashti, 49, and an unnamed co-conspirator from Iran said they were in contact with Damion Ryan, 43, a “full-patch member of the outlaw Hells Angels Motorcycle Club” using an encrypted communication platform, SkyECC, in December 2020 and early 2021.  Zindashti said Ryan should assemble a team to carry out a job in the US, the murder of an Iranian defector and a female companion living in Maryland. Ryan said it was “challenging” for him to do it, but he might know someone who was capable. Ryan then contacted another Canadian, Adam Pearson, who allegedly told him he had people he trusted to do it and that “shooting is probably easiest thing for them”.  Ryan is said to have suggested to Pearson he would need two or three other people. Pearson then said he would need $100,000, to which Ryan allegedly replied that Pearson would get as much money as he wanted but the job needed “to be over kill lol”. Pearson said he would tell his recruited team members to “to shoot [the victims] in the head a lot [to] make [an] example” adding “we gotta erase his head from his torso”.  In early February 2021 Zindashti told Ryan his organisation was ready to move forward with the plot and they agreed a fee of $350,000, plus $20,000 in travel expenses.  Prosecutors say Ryan and Pearson are currently imprisoned in Canada on unrelated charges.  “To those in Iran who plot murders on US soil and the criminal actors who work with them, let today’s charges send a clear message: the Department of Justice will pursue you as long as it takes – and wherever you are – and deliver justice,” the assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen, of the justice department’s national security division, said.  The US and UK governments announced joint measures against Zindashti’s ring on Monday.  “Zindashti’s network has carried out numerous acts of transnational repression including assassinations and kidnappings across multiple jurisdictions in an attempt to silence the Iranian regime’s perceived critics,” a Treasury statement said.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The German police blamed a series of attacks on synagogues in late 2022 on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which they said had organised the attacks through a German-Iranian biker gang boss, Ramin Yektaparast.  Yektaparast had been based in Tehran since fleeing there after the murder and dismemberment of a suspected informer in 2014, in a case dubbed the “Rocker-Torso Murder” in the German media.

According to statements by the justice department and the Treasury on Monday, the alleged drug smuggler Naji Sharifi Zindashti, ran an assassination ring on behalf of Iran’s ministry of intelligence and security (Mois). Elon Musk says Neuralink has implanted its first brain chip in human Read more The indictment against Zindashti, 49, and an unnamed co-conspirator from Iran said they were in contact with Damion Ryan, 43, a “full-patch member of the outlaw Hells Angels Motorcycle Club” using an encrypted communication platform, SkyECC, in December 2020 and early 2021. Zindashti said Ryan should assemble a team to carry out a job in the US, the murder of an Iranian defector and a female companion living in Maryland. Ryan said it was “challenging” for him to do it, but he might know someone who was capable. Ryan then contacted another Canadian, Adam Pearson, who allegedly told him he had people he trusted to do it and that “shooting is probably easiest thing for them”. Ryan is said to have suggested to Pearson he would need two or three other people. Pearson then said he would need $100,000, to which Ryan allegedly replied that Pearson would get as much money as he wanted but the job needed “to be over kill lol”. Pearson said he would tell his recruited team members to “to shoot [the victims] in the head a lot [to] make [an] example” adding “we gotta erase his head from his torso”. In early February 2021 Zindashti told Ryan his organisation was ready to move forward with the plot and they agreed a fee of $350,000, plus $20,000 in travel expenses. Prosecutors say Ryan and Pearson are currently imprisoned in Canada on unrelated charges. “To those in Iran who plot murders on US soil and the criminal actors who work with them, let today’s charges send a clear message: the Department of Justice will pursue you as long as it takes – and wherever you are – and deliver justice,” the assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen, of the justice department’s national security division , said. The US and UK governments announced joint measures against Zindashti’s ring on Monday. “Zindashti’s network has carried out numerous acts of transnational repression including assassinations and kidnappings across multiple jurisdictions in an attempt to silence the Iranian regime’s perceived critics,” a Treasury statement said . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The German police blamed a series of attacks on synagogues in late 2022 on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which they said had organised the attacks through a German-Iranian biker gang boss, Ramin Yektaparast. Yektaparast had been based in Tehran since fleeing there after the murder and dismemberment of a suspected informer in 2014, in a case dubbed the “Rocker-Torso Murder” in the German media.

5,https://www.collingwoodtoday.ca/local-news/canada-facing-a-crisis-in-hospital-emergency-care-8181658,"Canadian Medical Association said emergency rooms should be for emergency care, not a substitute for walk-in clinics or a missed doctor's appointment  The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) said Canada's hospital emergency rooms are in crisis ""and patients across Canada are waiting far too long to receive necessary care.""  The CMA said it's not just one hospital or community but a Canada-wide issue that needs to be addressed so that quick access to high-quality team-based primary care becomes the norm.  The information was part of a recent statement by CMA president Dr. Kathleen Ross, who said despite the best efforts of physicians, nurses and other health workers, some patients in Canada are waiting as long as 20 hours to get care.  ""Staff shortages and hospital overcrowding combined with poor access to high-quality team-based primary care are leaving hospital emergency departments woefully under-resourced for the avalanche of patients with influenza, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at this time of year,"" said Ross in a written statement.  She added that hospital ERs should be for emergencies and not a substitute for a walk-in clinic or a missed doctor's appointment.  Ross's comments are similar to the Ontario Auditor General's report on the state of Ontario hospital emergency rooms issued in December.  The auditor's report noted that ERs were facing a crisis because of the shortage of doctors and nurses which meant there was an unusually high demand for Locums (temporary fill-in physicians) at hospitals across Northern Ontario.  The auditor's report also published statistics (2022-23) on the time it took for an Ontario patient to be seen by a physician in the ER, with the South Bruce Grey Health Centre (Chesley) having the best time of roughly 35 minutes, while the Windsor Regional Hospital (Metropolitan campus) had the longest time of four hours and five minutes.  Collingwood General and Marine Hospital (CGMH) has an online ""clock"" showing wait times in the emergency department, a feature launched in the summer of 2022. at 10:30 a.m. on Jan. 30 the clock indicated a 1.5-hour wait to be seen by a doctor, with 19 patients in the emergency department currently. A graph showing historic trends indicates wait times ranging from more than one hour to almost three hours.  However, the emergency department is not a first-come, first-served system. It operates on a triage.  ""The sickest patients are treated first, therefore wait times may vary from the time displayed here,"" states the hospital website.  In November, 2023, the Collingwood hospital started a program offering same-day ER appointments for urgent ailments that could wait a few hours for treatment. The idea was streamlining the emergency visit process with five ""arrival times"" between 8 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. from Monday to Friday that people could book the night before or the same morning.  Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre in Barrie has a similar booking system in place.  “We do have an after-hours clinic and they’re always backlogged as well, in terms of those appointments, so I think there is a real need and it’s not just in this area; I think it’s across the province and across the country,” said CGMH president and CEO Mike Lacroix in an interview at the end of 2023. “I believe there will be a role and a place for this type of non-urgent scheduling in the hospital setting, especially in a smaller community like ours, where there (are) limited options as to who you can see and when.”  Lacroix said there's a need for innovation in healthcare.  “I think we can’t just sit back and keep doing the same things that we’ve been doing for all these years,” said Lacroix.

The CMA said it's not just one hospital or community but a Canada-wide issue that needs to be addressed so that quick access to high-quality team-based primary care becomes the norm. The information was part of a recent statement by CMA president Dr. Kathleen Ross, who said despite the best efforts of physicians, nurses and other health workers, some patients in Canada are waiting as long as 20 hours to get care. ""Staff shortages and hospital overcrowding combined with poor access to high-quality team-based primary care are leaving hospital emergency departments woefully under-resourced for the avalanche of patients with influenza, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at this time of year,"" said Ross in a written statement. She added that hospital ERs should be for emergencies and not a substitute for a walk-in clinic or a missed doctor's appointment. Ross's comments are similar to the Ontario Auditor General's report on the state of Ontario hospital emergency rooms issued in December. The auditor's report noted that ERs were facing a crisis because of the shortage of doctors and nurses which meant there was an unusually high demand for Locums (temporary fill-in physicians) at hospitals across Northern Ontario. The auditor's report also published statistics (2022-23) on the time it took for an Ontario patient to be seen by a physician in the ER, with the South Bruce Grey Health Centre (Chesley) having the best time of roughly 35 minutes, while the Windsor Regional Hospital (Metropolitan campus) had the longest time of four hours and five minutes. Collingwood General and Marine Hospital (CGMH) has an online ""clock"" showing wait times in the emergency department, a feature launched in the summer of 2022. at 10:30 a.m. on Jan. 30 the clock indicated a 1.5-hour wait to be seen by a doctor, with 19 patients in the emergency department currently. A graph showing historic trends indicates wait times ranging from more than one hour to almost three hours. However, the emergency department is not a first-come, first-served system. It operates on a triage. ""The sickest patients are treated first, therefore wait times may vary from the time displayed here,"" states the hospital website. In November, 2023, the Collingwood hospital started a program offering same-day ER appointments for urgent ailments that could wait a few hours for treatment. The idea was streamlining the emergency visit process with five ""arrival times"" between 8 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. from Monday to Friday that people could book the night before or the same morning. Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre in Barrie has a similar booking system in place. “We do have an after-hours clinic and they’re always backlogged as well, in terms of those appointments, so I think there is a real need and it’s not just in this area; I think it’s across the province and across the country,” said CGMH president and CEO Mike Lacroix in an interview at the end of 2023 . “I believe there will be a role and a place for this type of non-urgent scheduling in the hospital setting, especially in a smaller community like ours, where there (are) limited options as to who you can see and when.” Lacroix said there's a need for innovation in healthcare. “I think we can’t just sit back and keep doing the same things that we’ve been doing for all these years,” said Lacroix.

4,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/five-former-world-junior-players-to-face-sexual-assault-charges-tsn-1.6748552,"The remaining four hockey players called to present themselves with London, Ont., police are Michael McLeod and Cal Foote of the New Jersey Devils, Carter Hart of the Philadelphia Flyers, and Dillon Dube of the Calgary Flames, according to TSN.  Citing unnamed sources, the outlet reported the identities of the remaining four players, adding they are expected to surrender to police before Monday.  Last week, the Globe and Mail reported that five members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team will face sexual assault charges in connection to an alleged group sexual assault of a woman in a hotel room following a Hockey Canada event in June 2018.  In 2022, a woman identified as ""E.M."" sued Hockey Canada and eight unnamed players from the 2018 world junior team for $3.35 million, alleging she was repeatedly assaulted while intoxicated in a London, Ont., hotel room. The lawsuit was quickly settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.  None of the allegations against the players have been proven in court.  Alex Formenton, who last played in the NHL for the Ottawa Senators, is believed to be the first of the five to surrender. He had taken an indefinite leave of absence from his current team, HC Ambri-Piotta in Switzerland, on Wednesday and turned himself in to police on Sunday. Formenton's legal counsel told CTV News on Sunday he plans to ""vigorously defend his innocence.""  The Calgary Flames also announced Dillon Dube had been granted an indefinite leave of absence for ""mental health"" reasons and said he was ""under the care of health professionals."" Dube had signed with the Flames on a three-year, $6.9-million contract in August 2021. On Tuesday, his lawyers told TSN he was charged with sexual assault and intends to plead not guilty.  The New Jersey Devils announced on Wednesday both McLeod and Foote ""requested and (had) been granted indefinite leave of absences from the team."" McLeod had signed a one-year, $1.4-million contract last summer, while Foote had been on a one-year, $800,000 contract.  McLeod's lawyers have also confirmed that he was charged with sexual assault and will plead not guilty, The Canadian Press reported on Tuesday.

Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips Last week, the Globe and Mail reported that five members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team will face sexual assault charges in connection to an alleged group sexual assault of a woman in a hotel room following a Hockey Canada event in June 2018. RELATED STORIES Report: 5 members of Canada's 2018 junior hockey team to face sexual assault charges Former NHL player Alex Formenton has turned himself in to police, his lawyer says 'Nobody wins' in sexual assault cases, says survivors' advocate In 2022, a woman identified as ""E.M."" sued Hockey Canada and eight unnamed players from the 2018 world junior team for $3.35 million, alleging she was repeatedly assaulted while intoxicated in a London, Ont., hotel room. The lawsuit was quickly settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. None of the allegations against the players have been proven in court. Alex Formenton, who last played in the NHL for the Ottawa Senators, is believed to be the first of the five to surrender. He had taken an indefinite leave of absence from his current team, HC Ambri-Piotta in Switzerland, on Wednesday and turned himself in to police on Sunday. Formenton's legal counsel told CTV News on Sunday he plans to ""vigorously defend his innocence."" The Calgary Flames also announced Dillon Dube had been granted an indefinite leave of absence for ""mental health"" reasons and said he was ""under the care of health professionals."" Dube had signed with the Flames on a three-year, $6.9-million contract in August 2021. On Tuesday, his lawyers told TSN he was charged with sexual assault and intends to plead not guilty. The New Jersey Devils announced on Wednesday both McLeod and Foote ""requested and (had) been granted indefinite leave of absences from the team."" McLeod had signed a one-year, $1.4-million contract last summer, while Foote had been on a one-year, $800,000 contract. McLeod's lawyers have also confirmed that he was charged with sexual assault and will plead not guilty, The Canadian Press reported on Tuesday. Hart, who was on his final year of a three-year, $11.9-million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, had also been granted an indefinite leave of absence, citing ""personal reasons,"" according to Flyers general manager Daniel Briere. Hart's legal counsel also confirmed the sexual assault charge in a statement posted to X on Tuesday (opens in a new tab) , calling the allegations ""false."" Police in London, Ont. are scheduled to provide an update on the case at a press conference next Monday.

7,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/ups-is-cutting-12-000-jobs-1.6748019,"UPS announced Tuesday that it will cut 12,000 jobs as part of a bid to save US$1 billion in costs. Managers and contractor positions will make up most of the layoffs.  The job cuts come as UPS issued a disappointing sales outlook for this year, saying it expects global revenue of between $92 billion to $94.5 billion. That would be up from the $91 billion in revenue it reported for 2023, but analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been expecting revenue of at least $95.6 billion.  Advertisement  UPS lost business last year as customers concerned about a possible strike by the Teamsters shifted shipments to rival carriers, such as FedEx. Although UPS said it expects to get most of that business back, it had won back only about 60% of that lost business.  UPS’ business surged to record levels in the first three years of the pandemic, as online shopping exploded. The company’s sales topped $100 billion for the first time in 2022. The fact that revenue in 2023 fell more than 9% and won’t top that benchmark again in the near future is “candidly difficult and disappointing,” said CEO Carol Tome on a conference call with investors Tuesday.  “Some of this performance was due to the macro environment and some due to disruptions associated with our labour contract negotiations as well as higher costs associated with the new contract,” she said.  UPS’ (UPS) stock sank 7% on Tuesday.  Employee headcount at UPS had grown with the surge in business to about 540,000. It trimmed that headcount back to about 495,000 by the end of last year through attrition and reduced flying hours, rather than layoffs.  But the company forecast that the overall US small package market, excluding Amazon, will grow by less than 1% in 2024. The company also is dealing with a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, driving its efforts to cut other costs. And trimming salaried staff is a major part of its cost-cutting effort.  UPS said it has about 85,000 managers as part of its global workforce of nearly 500,000 employees. It has more than 300,000 hourly US workers represented by the Teamsters union.  “It’s a change in the way we work,” said CFO Brian Newman. “So as volume returns to the system, we don’t expect these jobs to come back. It’s changing the effective way that we operate.”","Layoffs in 2024: UPS cuts 12,000 jobs | CTV News Skip to main content Live (opens in a new tab) Search CTVNews.ca Search NEWS Canada World Opinion War in Ukraine Politics Inflation W5 Health Climate and Environment Sci-Tech Entertainment Lifestyle Business Sports Real Estate Israel-Hamas War Aging in Canada Weather Autos Nanos on the Numbers Newsletters Local Spotlight Photo Galleries Happening Now COVID in Canada VIDEO Video Hubs CTV News Atlantic Barrie Calgary Entertainment Edmonton Kitchener London Montreal Northern Ontario Ottawa Regina Saskatoon Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg SHOWS CTV National News Power Play Question Period W5 LIVE CTV News LIVE CTV News App Video Help Voice Assistant Help LOCAL Atlantic Barrie Calgary Edmonton Guelph Kingston Kitchener Lethbridge London Montreal Nanaimo Newfoundland and Labrador Northern Ontario Ottawa Pembroke Prince Albert Red Deer Regina Saskatoon Sault Ste.

Manulife-Loblaw deal raises concerns: experts Some pharmacare policy experts are raising concerns about competition and patient access to much-needed medication after Manulife Financial Corp. announced its coverage of certain prescription drugs will only apply at Loblaw Cos. Ltd. pharmacies. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The new arrangement, details of which were shared with plan holders earlier this month, affects around 260 medications under the insurance company’s Specialty Drug Care program. Drugs in this class are meant to treat complex, chronic or life-threatening conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s, multiple sclerosis , pulmonary arterial hypertension, cancer, osteoporosis and hepatitis C. Manulife said that starting Jan. 22, the program would transition to being carried out “primarily” through Shoppers Drug Mart and other Loblaw-owned pharmacies.

Suicide brought them both there. Ten years ago, the remote community, with a population of about 450, declared a state of emergency after four suicides and several attempted suicides by teens.

Several measures helped get to that point; there are mental-health counsellors who rotate into the community, outdoor activities that help youth connect with traditional practices, and festivals that bring community members together. The focus on building bonds is important, said Chief Chris Moonias.

The flood and avalanche risks remain elevated throughout British Columbia’s South Coast, where atmospheric rivers continue to bring heavy rains along with unseasonably warm temperatures. B.C.’s River Forecast Centre is maintaining a flood warning for the Squamish River, saying flows had reached somewhere between a two- and five-year return period at a gauge near Brackendale, north of the Squamish town centre.

2,https://www.dailynews.com/2024/01/30/9-southern-california-residents-charged-in-suspected-drug-trafficking-with-ties-to-canada-mexico/,"Nine Southern California residents have been charged in federal indictments targeting an alleged drug pipeline in which suspected members of a crime ring imported hundreds of pounds of cocaine and other narcotics from Mexico into Los Angeles bound for elsewhere in the United States and for Canada, officials said.  Two federal grand jury indictments unsealed Tuesday, Jan. 29, in Los Angeles charge 19 defendants for alleged roles in the organization, including accused importers, distributors, truck drivers and large-scale buyers.  “Today is an example of society pushing back,” said Donald Alway, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.  Authorities said the ring used Canadian handlers and dispatchers who traveled to Los Angeles to coordinate the pickup and delivery of large shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine. The drugs were loaded onto long-haul semi-trucks and driven from the United States to Canada via the Detroit Windsor Tunnel, the Buffalo Peace Bridge, and the Blue Water Bridge, investigators said.  The indictments allege the operation involved about 1,860 pounds of methamphetamine, 2,092 pounds of cocaine, 44 pounds of fentanyl and nearly nine pounds of heroin with an estimated total wholesale value of $16 million to $28 million. In addition, more than $900,000 was seized.  The years-long investigation was announced at a news conference in Westwood by officials from the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other agencies.  The nine Southern California defendants were 22 to 53 years old. They live in cities including Long Beach, Hemet, Riverside, Santa Ana and Ontario.  The defendants face federal charges such as drug trafficking and drug exportation conspiracies. If convicted as charged, each could face 40 years to life in federal prison, prosecutors said.","9 Southern California residents charged in suspected drug trafficking with ties to Canada, Mexico – Daily News Opens in a new window Opens an external website Opens an external website in a new window Close this dialog This website utilizes technologies such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as for analytics, personalization, and targeted advertising purposes.

Crime and Public Safety | 9 Southern California residents charged in suspected drug trafficking with ties to Canada, Mexico By City News Service | news@socalnews.com PUBLISHED: January 30, 2024 at 1:56 p.m. | UPDATED: January 30, 2024 at 1:57 p.m. Nine Southern California residents have been charged in federal indictments targeting an alleged drug pipeline in which suspected members of a crime ring imported hundreds of pounds of cocaine and other narcotics from Mexico into Los Angeles bound for elsewhere in the United States and for Canada, officials said. Two federal grand jury indictments unsealed Tuesday, Jan. 29, in Los Angeles charge 19 defendants for alleged roles in the organization, including accused importers, distributors, truck drivers and large-scale buyers. “Today is an example of society pushing back,” said Donald Alway, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. Authorities said the ring used Canadian handlers and dispatchers who traveled to Los Angeles to coordinate the pickup and delivery of large shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine. The drugs were loaded onto long-haul semi-trucks and driven from the United States to Canada via the Detroit Windsor Tunnel, the Buffalo Peace Bridge, and the Blue Water Bridge, investigators said. The indictments allege the operation involved about 1,860 pounds of methamphetamine, 2,092 pounds of cocaine, 44 pounds of fentanyl and nearly nine pounds of heroin with an estimated total wholesale value of $16 million to $28 million. In addition, more than $900,000 was seized. Related Articles Crime and Public Safety | She says she was raped by a Lyft driver and had a child.

Shadd, born in 1823 in Wilmington, Del., was an activist who broke boundaries to fight for the rights of Black people and women. She was an abolitionist, educator, newspaper publisher and lawyer.  In 1851, Shadd was invited to teach in Windsor, Ont., where she helped open a racially integrated school that supported families fleeing enslavement in the United States, a Canada Post description reads.  Two years later, she started the Provincial Freeman, becoming the first Black woman in North America, as well as the first woman in Canada, to publish and edit a newspaper. It was published from Windsor and later from Toronto and Chatham.  The Provincial Freeman was an anti-slavery newspaper advocating for the advancement and equality of Black people. It also promoted Canada as a place where Black people could settle, raise families and contribute as free citizens.  Shadd initially kept her name off the masthead to avoid alienating readers; however, she revealed her identity in 1854.  She moved back to the U.S. in 1863. She became the second Black American woman to obtain a law degree and became a lawyer and prominent suffragist.  Her father, Abraham Doras Shadd, who was active in the Underground Railroad, was honoured on Canada Post’s first Black History Month stamp in 2009.  The Mary Ann Shadd stamp was revealed in late January in Chatham, where Shadd spent most of her years while living in Canada. The stamp was designed by Underline Studio and illustrated by Natasha Cunningham.",,"[{'src': 'https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/news/nep4jhbcdb-g5co6gtexr/JADEN_STAPLES_STILL.jpg?w=1200&quality=70&strip=all', 'width': 640.0, 'height': 360.0, 'area': 230400.0}]","Canada Post releases stamp honouring Mary Ann Shadd, abolitionist, educator, newspaper publisher and lawyer",7 hours ago,Canada,https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/news/nep4jhbcdb-g5co6gtexr/JADEN_STAPLES_STILL.jpg?w=1200&quality=70&strip=all

Earlier this month, two federal grand juries in Los Angeles returned indictments on the 19 suspects for their alleged roles in the drug trafficking ring that included an Italian organized crime figure, Mexican-based drug suppliers, U.S. distributors, and Canadian truck drivers operating in the U.S., the FBI said.  ""This organized group worked as a conspiracy with impunity throughout North America,"" Don Alway, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said during a Tuesday news conference. ""Today is an example of society pushing back and delivering a blow to groups like this who are unconcerned about the health and safety of individuals when they bring drugs into communities.""  FORMER ICE DETAINEE DRESSED AS DELIVERY DRIVER KILLS 3 INSIDE HOME WITH KIDS PRESENT: POLICE  The investigation, known as ""Operation Dead Hand,"" alleges that an unnamed organized crime group used Canadian ""handlers"" and ""dispatchers"" who traveled to the U.S. for short periods of time, and coordinated the pick-up and delivery of large shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine, which were loaded onto long-haul semi-trucks bound for Canada.  Drivers working with dozens of trucking companies coordinated the transportation of the drugs and made numerous border crossings from the U.S. into Canada, authorities said. The crossings were made through the Detroit Windsor Tunnel in Michigan, the Buffalo Peace Bridge in Buffalo, New York, and the Blue Water Bridge, also in Michigan.  Authorities in California, Texas, and the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto and Calgary, executed search warrants Tuesday, resulting in 10 arrests. The indictments allege the drug trafficking activity involved 1,860 pounds of methamphetamine, 2,092 pounds of cocaine, 44 pounds of fentanyl, and nearly nine pounds of heroin.  During the investigation, authorities seized between $16 million to $28 million in drugs, and more than $900,000 in cash.

1,https://www.castlegarnews.com/sports/no-olympic-bronze-for-canada-despite-russian-figure-skating-disqualification-7311571,"Even without Valieva, Russian team still had enough points to finish 3rd in Beijing team event  Skate Canada said Tuesday it was “extremely disappointed” with the International Skating Union’s position on the awarding of medals from the figure skating team competition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and will “consider all options to appeal.”  Despite the disqualification of Kamila Valieva in a doping case, the Russian figure skating team still stands to finish on the podium and get bronze medals from the 2022 Beijing Olympics ahead of fourth-place Canada.  The Americans moved into the gold medal position in the team event and Japan was upgraded to silver from bronze. The demoted Russians drop into third place, one point ahead of Canada even after being stripped of the points the then-15-year-old Valieva earned on the ice.  The ISU published an amended points table from the Beijing competition that took Valieva’s maximum 10 points from each of her two events but did not add an extra point to the other teams below her.  “The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that in addition to a four-year ban from competition, the ban includes ‘the disqualification (of) all competitive results’ achieved by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva since the positive test,” Skate Canada said in a statement.  “The ISU in its recent decision is not applying Rule 353, which states that ‘competitors having finished the competition and who initially placed lower than the disqualified competitor will move up accordingly in their placement.’  “Skate Canada strongly disagrees with the ISU’s position on this matter and will consider all options to appeal this decision.”  Valieva was disqualified by the CAS on Monday from all of her events since December 2021 and banned for four years in a doping case that took almost two years to resolve. She turns 18 in April.  The final decision on awarding medals is for the International Olympic Committee, which the ISU said was consulted before completing its duty as the event organizer to amend the result.  “The ISU is in close contact with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant ISU member federations in regard to the implementation of this decision,” the governing body said.  Skate Canada likely can challenge the ISU decision at CAS. A message left with the Canadian Olympic Committee was not immediately returned.  Canada still gets eight points out of 10 from the women’s short program and free skate sections, where its skater was Maddie Schizas of Oakville, Ont.  Other Canadian team members in Beijing were Piper Gilles, Paul Poirier, Kirsten Moore-Towers, Michael Marinaro, Eric Radford, Vanessa James and Roman Sadovsky, a last-minute replacement for Keegan Messing.  Japan still gets nine points each time for originally finishing second to Valieva, through Wakaba Higuchi in the short program and Kaori Sakamoto in the free skate.  Canada’s overall points total remained 53 and the Russians’ tally dropped from 74 to 54 — enough for the bronze medals which Valieva’s teammates will get but she will not.  Skate Canada did not address the question of medal reallocation in a statement issued on Monday. It praised the ruling to disqualify Valieva which it said “underscores the significance of stringent anti-doping measures and the need for continuous vigilance in protecting the integrity of figure skating and all sports.”  A Canadian appeal to the court in Lausanne, Switzerland, could extend the case for about another year.  That would stall a medal ceremony which did not take place in Beijing because details of Valieva’s positive test for a banned heart medicine emerged hours after she skated and sealed the Russian win.  In Russia on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Valieva and her five teammates from two years ago were still considered winners.  “Upon their return from China we honoured these athletes as Olympic champions,” Peskov said. “We are convinced that they will always remain Olympic champions to us, whatever decisions may be taken in that regard, even unfair ones.”  The IOC executive board has its next scheduled meeting from March 19-21 in Lausanne at the same time Canada is hosting the figure skating world championships in Montreal.  The Olympic leadership is in South Korea for the Youth Winter Games and could address the skating medal issue there.

Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva has been disqualified from the 2022 Beijing Olympics. The verdict from the Court of Arbitration for Sport comes almost two years after Valieva’s doping case caused turmoil at the Beijing Games. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File) Skate Canada said Tuesday it was “extremely disappointed” with the International Skating Union’s position on the awarding of medals from the figure skating team competition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and will “consider all options to appeal.” Despite the disqualification of Kamila Valieva in a doping case, the Russian figure skating team still stands to finish on the podium and get bronze medals from the 2022 Beijing Olympics ahead of fourth-place Canada. The Americans moved into the gold medal position in the team event and Japan was upgraded to silver from bronze. The demoted Russians drop into third place, one point ahead of Canada even after being stripped of the points the then-15-year-old Valieva earned on the ice. The ISU published an amended points table from the Beijing competition that took Valieva’s maximum 10 points from each of her two events but did not add an extra point to the other teams below her. “The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that in addition to a four-year ban from competition, the ban includes ‘the disqualification (of) all competitive results’ achieved by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva since the positive test,” Skate Canada said in a statement. “The ISU in its recent decision is not applying Rule 353, which states that ‘competitors having finished the competition and who initially placed lower than the disqualified competitor will move up accordingly in their placement.’ “Skate Canada strongly disagrees with the ISU’s position on this matter and will consider all options to appeal this decision.” Valieva was disqualified by the CAS on Monday from all of her events since December 2021 and banned for four years in a doping case that took almost two years to resolve. She turns 18 in April. The final decision on awarding medals is for the International Olympic Committee, which the ISU said was consulted before completing its duty as the event organizer to amend the result. “The ISU is in close contact with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant ISU member federations in regard to the implementation of this decision,” the governing body said. Skate Canada likely can challenge the ISU decision at CAS. A message left with the Canadian Olympic Committee was not immediately returned. Canada still gets eight points out of 10 from the women’s short program and free skate sections, where its skater was Maddie Schizas of Oakville, Ont. Other Canadian team members in Beijing were Piper Gilles, Paul Poirier, Kirsten Moore-Towers, Michael Marinaro, Eric Radford, Vanessa James and Roman Sadovsky, a last-minute replacement for Keegan Messing. Japan still gets nine points each time for originally finishing second to Valieva, through Wakaba Higuchi in the short program and Kaori Sakamoto in the free skate. Canada’s overall points total remained 53 and the Russians’ tally dropped from 74 to 54 — enough for the bronze medals which Valieva’s teammates will get but she will not. Skate Canada did not address the question of medal reallocation in a statement issued on Monday. It praised the ruling to disqualify Valieva which it said “underscores the significance of stringent anti-doping measures and the need for continuous vigilance in protecting the integrity of figure skating and all sports.” A Canadian appeal to the court in Lausanne, Switzerland, could extend the case for about another year. That would stall a medal ceremony which did not take place in Beijing because details of Valieva’s positive test for a banned heart medicine emerged hours after she skated and sealed the Russian win. In Russia on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Valieva and her five teammates from two years ago were still considered winners. “Upon their return from China we honoured these athletes as Olympic champions,” Peskov said. “We are convinced that they will always remain Olympic champions to us, whatever decisions may be taken in that regard, even unfair ones.” The IOC executive board has its next scheduled meeting from March 19-21 in Lausanne at the same time Canada is hosting the figure skating world championships in Montreal. The Olympic leadership is in South Korea for the Youth Winter Games and could address the skating medal issue there.

Investigators say one of the men called police to report he and a friend were lost in a swampy area east of the city around 9 a.m. Monday.  The man told police the pair had been lost in the woods for for several hours.  “Both men had become cold overnight and the one male did not have proper footwear to be walking through wet / swampy land,” Belleville police spokesperson Jeff Green said in an email to Global News.  “The men attempted to use the compass on their phone to navigate their way to safety however it was not working properly and they ended up calling the Belleville Police for assistance.”  Story continues below advertisement  Green says officers were on the ground in the area by 9:21 a.m., the service’s drone was in the air by 9:34 a.m. and the men were located with the help of the device’s thermal imaging camera by 9:38 a.m.  Get the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day.  “The drone not only found the lost persons in less than 4 minutes, but also minimized the resources required and can obviously cover a large search area in a much more efficient time than officers can do on foot,” Green said.  “The drone was definitely a very effective tool available to the members responding.”  Footage from the drone provided by police show officers trudging through bush before meeting up with the two missing men, who were ultimately located roughly 500 metres east of Haig Road.  The men, aged 55 and 33, were assessed at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital for precautionary measures, police said.  Other than being cold, Green said neither of the men were hurt.  With thermal imaging capabilities, a large spot light and an audio speaker, Green says the police drone has been become a “a very valuable tool for a variety of police functions.”  As well as being helpful for lost and missing person calls, Green says the drone is used to watch over large gatherings, for suspect apprehensions, crime scene mapping and has been called in to help the Belleville Fire Department find hot spots at fires.","(1) 2 Ontario men lost for hours in woods found thanks to thermal imaging drone | Globalnews.ca SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT In the news Amelia Earhart Stanley Cup Taylor Swift McRib Global News Home Subscribe Site theme toggle.

But Adobe has cast doubt on Nine News’s claim about its software, after the network broadcast the image during Monday night’s bulletin.  The program’s news director, Hugh Nailon, apologised to the upper house Animal Justice Party MP on Tuesday for the “graphic error”, and blamed “automation by Photoshop”.  “Our graphics department sourced an online image of Georgie to use in our story on duck hunting. As is common practice, the image was resized to fit our specs,” he said.  “During that process, the automation by Photoshop created an image that was not consistent with the original. This did not meet the high editorial standards we have and for that we apologise to Ms Purcell unreservedly.”  But in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Adobe said use of its generative AI features would have required “human intervention”.  “Any changes to this image would have required human intervention and approval,” the spokesperson said.  Purcell said she realised the image had been edited when she compared it to the original, taken in 2023.  She said it had topped off the “worst” day she had since she was first elected, given the government’s decision to reject a ban on duck hunting.  I endured a lot yesterday.

It’s not abnormal for politicians to have catastrophic days at work. I’m not afraid to say yesterday was the worst I’ve had so far,” she said in a statement to Guardian Australia.  “Unfortunately, the difference for women is that they also have to deal with the constant sexualisation and objectification that comes with having images leaked, distorted and AI generated.”  Purcell said the incident was another example of the discrimination and barriers that women in politics face.  “Let’s be clear – this is not something that happens to my male colleagues,” she said.  “The message this sends to young women and girls across Victoria is that even at the top of your field, your body is always up for grabs.”  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Melbourne-based Photoshop tutor David Ewing said the editing of the photo was “no accident”.  “The [statement] has an underlying tone that Photoshop has done this with a mind of its own, but that mind needs to be told what to do, so that means selecting the top and telling it to make it shorter and then that process is automated,” he told Guardian Australia.  “Photoshop would do nothing by itself other than open the photo. Someone has told Photoshop how to edit a part of the image that they have selected.”  The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, who also appeared in the graphic but whose image did not appear to be edited, said the incident was concerning.  “That’s no way to represent any woman, let alone a woman who holds a position in public office, represents a community and is in the public discourse every single day,” she told reporters.  “Let’s think about the message that it sends, particularly to young women, the distorted images that women see day after day.”","Victorian MP Georgie Purcell criticises Nine News for ‘sexist’ image editing to make outfit more revealing | Australian media | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland Georgie Purcell says she had her ‘body and outfit Photoshopped by the media’ after the image appeared on Nine News in Melbourne on Monday.

The Epping man, 25, was arrested in Bundoora in Melbourne’s north just after 3pm on Tuesday. Detective Inspector Graham Banks told reporters it’s believed the man is a “significant ring leader” who acted for a crime gang. Investigators allege the man is in contact with the head of the syndicate based overseas and had been coordinating the fires. The 25-year-old is being interviewed over several arson attacks on Melbourne businesses from October to December in 2023. They include fires at a smash repair business in Williamstown, a Glenroy tobacco store, a Tullamarine reception centre, two blazes at a Docklands restaurant and another at a different Docklands restaurant. Victoria Police have said it’s believed Middle Eastern organised crime groups and outlaw motorcycle gangs are in competition for profits from illicit tobacco and use low-level criminals to carry out attacks.  Updated at 06.53 GMT  16h ago 06.33 GMT Two Aboriginal children stranded in UK since 2020, peak body says Two Aboriginal children who have been stranded in the UK without passports or visas since 2020 while courts decided their guardianship must be immediately brought home, the nation’s peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children says. The chief executive of SNAICC, Catherine Liddle, said it “beggared belief” that any government agency would allow vulnerable children to be “trapped in limbo” as “unwanted aliens in a distant country, with no family or cultural links”. She said: The fact they are in the UK in the first place is yet another demonstration of how child protection systems are failing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families. These Aboriginal children should be in their country, with their family and community, maintaining their connection to culture.

Three people were taken to Sydney hospitals on the weekend after taking a form of nitazenes, which are strong synthetic opioids that can cause severe overdose or death. Those hospitalised ingested half a pill, with one person treated in the intensive care unit. Tests on one pill – which was stamped with the Red Bull logo – found traces of nitazene and no MDMA.

Purcell lashed Nine News Melbourne over the “sexist editing” of the image that made her breasts look bigger and exposed her midriff, which was shown during the Monday night’s bulletin. The program’s news director, Hugh Nailon, apologised to the Animal Justice party MP on Tuesday for the “graphic error” and blamed “automation by Photoshop”. But in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Adobe said use of its generative AI features would have required “human intervention”.

In a speech praising the mining industry, and its contribution to Australia’s economic coffers, Dutton said he was “concerned about our national economy and the wellbeing of Australians” – citing cost of living pressures, inflation and rising prices. The opposition leader accused the government of “implementing ideological policies which are proving lethal for our national economy”, particularly claiming the resource industry was at risk. Pointing to Anthony Albanese’s broken promise on the stage-three tax cuts, Dutton raised concerns about whether the government would make changes to negative gearing, franking credits, or fuel tax credits. The franking credits issue was weaponised by the Coalition as a “retirees tax” in the 2019 election. Labor hasn’t made moves to resurrect that policy since. View image in fullscreen The opposition leader, Peter Dutton: ‘We’ve started this debate [for nuclear power in Australia] – and it’s gone unbelievably well.’ Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Dutton went on to back in the Coalition’s rhetoric on small modular reactors and nuclear technology. “We’ve started this debate – and it’s gone unbelievably well, I might say,” he claimed. “It was 31% support to start. It’s moved to 52%, and particularly for a lot of younger people who are well researched on the topic, we’ve seen the fact that 50 countries are embracing nuclear technology.”    Dutton said “very clearly, we need to have a national debate about how we can provide support to renewables going into the system, as the transition of our energy system takes place, and we’re all embracing that”.  Updated at 05.59 GMT  17h ago 05.50 GMT Josh Butler Coalition ‘weren’t a tight team’: Dutton Commenting on the ABC’s Nemesis program, aired last night, and which chronicles the Liberals’ last decade in power, opposition leader Peter Dutton has admitted the Coalition “weren’t a tight team” in 2007 after John Howard’s election defeat. Speaking in Perth in an address to the Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA, Dutton said “going into opposition is always a miserable place”. I say to people in business – and I had a business career before I came into politics, as well – it’s like going bankrupt on Saturday night, the bank turning up, taking the keys, kicking you out of your building and then you’ve got to recreate the opportunity and amass your fortune over the next three years. And you can only do that if you have a tight team. In 2007, when John Howard lost the election, we weren’t a tight team – we saw some of that evidenced on the ABC last night. But we’re in a very different space now, we’re a credible opposition, and part of that is the very significant engagement being undertaken by my colleagues.  Updated at 05.55 GMT  17h ago 05.40 GMT Allan says Fowles will not return to Labor party, says complainant will be supported The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has issued a strongly worded statement about the closure of the police investigation into former Labor MP Will Fowles. Fowles resigned from the parliamentary Labor party last year over an alleged incident that was described by the then premier, Daniel Andrews, as a “serious assault”. Fowles has strenuously denied any wrongdoing, and welcomed the end of the investigation. Police issued a statement earlier on Tuesday saying that a “rigorous and methodical investigation” by the sexual crimes squad into the reported incident in the Melbourne CBD last year had concluded and “in conjunction with senior legal advice, it has been determined that charges will not be laid”. Allan said on Tuesday afternoon: The wellbeing of staff and their right to a safe workplace is not negotiable and we will always act on any allegations of a serious nature. Victoria police has now concluded an investigation into the member for Ringwood. The member for Ringwood was asked to resign from the parliamentary Labor party in August last year. He will not return. The complainant will continue to be supported and their privacy must be respected at this time.

Flannery said the catchment area was already saturated after intense rainfall on Monday night and Tuesday morning sparked road closures, livestock issues and landslides. He said there were more than 84 calls for assistance and 10 swift water rescues in the Bray Park area. View image in fullscreen A flooded street in Caboolture. Photograph: QAS Around 92 roads were closed as of 1pm AEST and 100 homes were without power in the region. Samford, Bray Park and Caboolture South were some of the worst impacted by the storms, according to the mayor. “Samford received 244mm of rainfall since midnight. There is a 0.05% chance of this happening annually, making the rainfall event in Samford extreme,” he said. “Bray Park had 235mm since midnight and 275 mm was recorded at Bribie Island Road.” Flannery said these levels “far exceeded” those experienced in these areas during the 2022 floods. Six evacuation areas are open for the community, with concern remaining for the upper Caboolture River. Residents are encouraged to monitor the city’s Disaster Dashboard for emergency information.

I have always maintained my innocence and I am looking forward to continuing my work for my constituents in parliament. Last year, Fowles resigned from the parliamentary Labor party over an alleged incident that was described by the then premier, Daniel Andrews, as a “serious assault”. Fowles has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. In October, Fowles was arrested and interviewed by the sexual crimes squad but released without charge. Today, Victoria police confirmed an investigation by the sexual crimes squad into the reported incident in the Melbourne CBD last year has concluded.  Updated at 05.28 GMT  17h ago 05.03 GMT Man released after high court ruling charged with alleged offences The Australian federal police have confirmed another person released after the high court’s ruling on indefinite detention has been charged with further alleged offending. The AFP said in a statement that the man was arrested and charged today after he was found in Footscray, a suburb in Melbourne’s inner west. He is alleged to have breached the conditions of his visa on 28 and 29 January by failing to observe his residential curfew obligations, the AFP said. It said the man, who was born in Eritrea, was expected to face court today and had been charged with five offences relating to allegedly failing to comply with his visa-mandated curfew and maintain a monitoring device. The offences carry maximum penalties of five years’ imprisonment.

Updated at 07.31 GMT 16h ago 06.50 GMT Arrest over series of arson attacks in Melbourne A man has been arrested over a string of suspicious fires in Melbourne which are believed to be linked to a dispute between crime syndicates over illegal tobacco, AAP report. The Epping man, 25, was arrested in Bundoora in Melbourne’s north just after 3pm on Tuesday. Detective Inspector Graham Banks told reporters it’s believed the man is a “significant ring leader” who acted for a crime gang. Investigators allege the man is in contact with the head of the syndicate based overseas and had been coordinating the fires. The 25-year-old is being interviewed over several arson attacks on Melbourne businesses from October to December in 2023. They include fires at a smash repair business in Williamstown, a Glenroy tobacco store, a Tullamarine reception centre, two blazes at a Docklands restaurant and another at a different Docklands restaurant. Victoria Police have said it’s believed Middle Eastern organised crime groups and outlaw motorcycle gangs are in competition for profits from illicit tobacco and use low-level criminals to carry out attacks. Updated at 06.53 GMT 16h ago 06.33 GMT Two Aboriginal children stranded in UK since 2020, peak body says Two Aboriginal children who have been stranded in the UK without passports or visas since 2020 while courts decided their guardianship must be immediately brought home, the nation’s peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children says. The chief executive of SNAICC, Catherine Liddle , said it “beggared belief” that any government agency would allow vulnerable children to be “trapped in limbo” as “unwanted aliens in a distant country, with no family or cultural links”. She said: The fact they are in the UK in the first place is yet another demonstration of how child protection systems are failing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families. These Aboriginal children should be in their country, with their family and community, maintaining their connection to culture.

Three people were taken to Sydney hospitals on the weekend after taking a form of nitazenes, which are strong synthetic opioids that can cause severe overdose or death. Those hospitalised ingested half a pill, with one person treated in the intensive care unit. Tests on one pill – which was stamped with the Red Bull logo – found traces of nitazene and no MDMA.

Purcell lashed Nine News Melbourne over the “sexist editing” of the image that made her breasts look bigger and exposed her midriff, which was shown during the Monday night’s bulletin. The program’s news director, Hugh Nailon, apologised to the Animal Justice party MP on Tuesday for the “graphic error” and blamed “automation by Photoshop”. But in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Adobe said use of its generative AI features would have required “human intervention”.

In a speech praising the mining industry, and its contribution to Australia’s economic coffers, Dutton said he was “concerned about our national economy and the wellbeing of Australians” – citing cost of living pressures, inflation and rising prices. The opposition leader accused the government of “implementing ideological policies which are proving lethal for our national economy”, particularly claiming the resource industry was at risk. Pointing to Anthony Albanese’s broken promise on the stage-three tax cuts, Dutton raised concerns about whether the government would make changes to negative gearing, franking credits, or fuel tax credits. The franking credits issue was weaponised by the Coalition as a “retirees tax” in the 2019 election. Labor hasn’t made moves to resurrect that policy since. View image in fullscreen The opposition leader, Peter Dutton: ‘We’ve started this debate [for nuclear power in Australia] – and it’s gone unbelievably well.’ Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Dutton went on to back in the Coalition’s rhetoric on small modular reactors and nuclear technology. “We’ve started this debate – and it’s gone unbelievably well, I might say,” he claimed. “It was 31% support to start. It’s moved to 52%, and particularly for a lot of younger people who are well researched on the topic, we’ve seen the fact that 50 countries are embracing nuclear technology.” Dutton said “very clearly, we need to have a national debate about how we can provide support to renewables going into the system, as the transition of our energy system takes place, and we’re all embracing that”.

The assembly – the state’s democratically elected Indigenous body – will begin negotiating a state-wide treaty with the state government this year. Guardian Australia has confirmed Andy Gargett has emailed assembly members saying he will not extend his time in the position and will depart in the middle of the year. In the email, he said it was important for an Indigenous person to fill the role. Last week, the opposition announced it would withdraw its support for a treaty process with First Nations Victorians , less than a week before Australia Day. The opposition cited issues with the state’s cultural heritage legislation as a key reason for its backflip.

8,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/twenty20-international-live-australia-women-south-africa-women/103406006,"Australia have bounced back from a shock T20 loss to South Africa, clinching success in a tense series decider on the back of a classy 82 from Beth Mooney.  The opener's 55-ball knock helped Australia get past the visitors' 7-162 with five wickets in hand and four balls to spare in Hobart on Tuesday night.  Mooney lost partners regularly before falling in the 18th over with her side needing 14 runs from 14 balls.  Ash Gardner (26 not out from 17 deliveries) held her nerve to seal the win with a boundary.  South Africa earlier posted their highest T20 score against Australia, headlined by a career-best 48-ball 75 from Marizanne Kapp.  South Africa forced a deciding T20 game after notching their first women's victory over Australia in any format on Sunday to level the ledger at 1-1.  The three T20s games are part of a multi-format series including three ODIs and one Test match.  South African all-rounder Marizanne Kapp shared an 80-run partnership from just 57 balls with Anneke Bosch. ( AAP: Linda Higginson )  Mooney, who hit an unbeaten 72 in the opening game against South Africa, struck the ball cleanly from the outset and finished with 11 fours and one six.  Fellow opener Alyssa Healy (10) failed to fire, as did Ellyse Perry (13), who was elevated to number 3.  After her team was sent in to bat, Kapp helped South Africa recover from a wobbly 3-28 in the fifth over.  The all-rounder shared an 80-run partnership from just 57 balls with Anneke Bosch, who supported well with 21.  Kapp's score in her 100th T20 international surpassed her previous best of 56 and came after she was dropped on 19 in the outfield.  She was dismissed in the 17th over when Tahlia McGrath snuck in a slower ball that crashed into the stumps.  Australia's Grace Harris was in the action early, taking two catches and running out Sune Luus with a direct hit.  Chloe Tryon chipped in with an important 26 from 16 balls late in the innings before being caught and bowled by spinner Georgia Wareham in the 18th over.  Nadine de Klerk also swung hard at the death, finishing with an unbeaten 20 from 11 balls including two fours off the last three deliveries.  Wareham was Australia's most economical bowler with 1-25 from four overs, while quick Darcie Brown (0-27 from two overs) copped some stick after sitting out the last match.

The photo of Georgie Purcell appeared in a Nine News bulletin after she criticised the Victorian government's rejection of a duck hunting ban. Ms Purcell posted the original and altered images to social media, noting how her outfit had been edited. Nine News apologised and claimed ""automation by Photoshop"" was to blame.

End of twitter post by Georgie Purcell Ms Purcell is the youngest woman in the state's parliament and has frequently called out the ""constant sexualisation and objectification"" that women in Australian politics face. Speaking to the BBC, the Animal Justice Party MP said seeing the image had capped off what had already been her worst day since being elected in 2022. ""It's certainly confronting seeing your body altered on your TV in your own home,"" she said. ""What has happened to me in the past 24 hours is just something that would never, ever happen to a male politician."" Other politicians and members of the public have also been outraged. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan - who herself was controversially depicted naked in a newspaper cartoon last year , said: ""That's no way to represent any woman, let alone a woman who holds a position in public office."" Nine News Melbourne boss Hugh Nailon has ""unreservedly"" apologised to Ms Purcell for the ""graphic error"". ""As is common practice, the image was resized to fit our specs. During that process, the automation by Photoshop created an image that was not consistent with the original,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to a tool which uses AI to expand pictures. ""This did not meet the high editorial standards we have."" But in a statement, a spokesperson for Adobe - the firm which produces Photoshop - told the BBC: ""Any changes to this image would have required human intervention and approval."" Ms Purcell said while she accepts Nine's apology, she is sceptical of their explanation. But if it was an accident, she says, it raises concerns about the threat of AI to women in public life and why newsroom staff did not notice her outfit had been sexualised. ""This is not just some random person on the internet. This is a organisation with a lot of staff and a lot of resources that frankly should know better."" Ms Purcell, who has previously spoken about working as a stripper to support herself through law school, has long been a target for sexist abuse, and says the altered image has already reinvigorated it. ""[They are] criticising me, telling me to get back on the pole, like weaponising it against me,"" she said. In recent years, Australian politics more broadly has been grappling with what women say is a prevailing sexist culture. A landmark report in 2021 - triggered by an alleged rape inside Australia's Parliament House - found a third of employees in federal parliament had been sexually harassed.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2024/jan/31/melbourne-weather-forecast-heatwaves-under-35-record,"Melbourne is about to mark an unusual milestone. So far this summer the Bureau of Meteorology has not classified any single day as “hot” – that is, above 35C.  While other parts of the country have sweltered through severe heatwaves, the first month of 2024 has recorded no days above 35C, as observed at the BoM’s Melbourne Olympic Park weather station. On 12 January it was 33.4C and on 13 December it was 34C, but the last time the city’s mercury nudged over 35C was 18 March last year.  And the forecast for January’s last day has the city stuck in the low 20s, though the mercury will rise into the 30s this weekend.  The last time Melbourne recorded zero hot days in January was in 1984.  “It’s interesting this summer, and the summers before this,” Dr Linden Ashcroft, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia. “We’ve seen a red map across all of Australia but the south-eastern part, across to south-eastern Victoria, is not showing red.”  According to the weather station on La Trobe Street, which was replaced by the Olympic Park one in 2015, Melbourne averages two hot days in December, 3.6 in January and 2.7 in February.  But the city recorded three January days above 35C in 2023 and two in 2022. This contrasts with five days in 2019 and four in 2020.  In 1998 and 2009 there were eight hot days in January. In 1981 there were 11.  Though the temperature didn’t crack 35C in January in 1984, 1980 and 1977, in those summers there were hot days in December – unlike this year. You have to go back more than 50 years – to 1971-72 – to find a Melbourne summer that wasn’t hot by the end of January.  Average temperatures in December 2023 and January 2024 have also been below the historical trend.  What’s behind the lack of hot days?  In September an El Niño event was declared and predicted to deliver drier and warmer conditions but so far this hasn’t been the case for Melbourne.  From late 2020 to mid-2022, Australia experienced an intense La Niña period, which could be behind some of city’s more milder temperatures. La Niña years tend to bring about cooler-than-average maximum temperatures because of more cloud cover and rainfall.  The BoM noted that for the warmer half of the year, “southern coastal locations like Adelaide and Melbourne experience fewer individual daily heat extremes during La Niña years but an increased frequency of prolonged warm spells”.  But the city is also going through a positive southern annular mode, or Sam conditions – a climate driver responsible for changes to temperature and rainfall.  “During this January, a number of cold fronts moved either across southern Victoria or to the south of the continent,” a BoM spokesperson said. “In both cases they were followed by ridges of high pressure that directed southerly or south-easterly airflow across the state, bringing cooler temperatures.”  Long-term trend is still upwards  Overall, Melbourne is still getting hotter. “If you look at the absolute hottest temperatures recorded in the city, that value is increasing,” Ashcroft said.  “The long-term trend is still upwards. We’ve had a few years of stability or maybe slightly lower than average [temperatures] but it’s still warmer than it was 50 years ago.”  While Melbourne might have had fewer really hot days in the last few years, “when it is hot, it’s really hot” and “it has been humid”, Ashcroft said.  According to a BoM spokesperson, Sam “increases chances of on-shore easterly airflow and rainfall for eastern and southeastern Australia”.  “This further contributes to increased humidity of the air, cloudiness and rainfall particularly for eastern Victoria, resulting in cooler daily maximum temperatures.”  Ashcroft said this humidity was probably why Melburnians had felt warmer, particularly overnight . “If you are sleeping rough or if you are vulnerable in any way, it can be really detrimental,” she said.  According to a Weatherzone spokesperson, Melbourne’s relative “feels like” temperature estimates this month have been “about 0.8C warmer compared to the January 2021-2023 years”.  Weatherzone’s “feels like” measure is based on how the average person might feel given humidity and windspeed. The more humid it is, the hotter it will feel; if the wind is blowing, a person may feel a chill even though the temperature isn’t cold.  Globally 2023 was the hottest year on record, while in Australia it was the eighth hottest year. Heatwaves continue to increase in frequency, intensity and duration across the country.  At this stage there is no strong suggestion of a heatwave developing in Victoria.  What remains uncertain is how the climate crisis will continue to affect weather across the state and the country.","Melbourne weathers its first January without a ‘hot’ day since 1984 | Melbourne | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Spectators brave wet weather at the Australian Open.

6,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/peter-dutton-pressure-stage-three-tax-cuts-liberal-national-seats-benefit,"The Albanese government is heaping pressure on the Dutton opposition to support its income tax changes, releasing its own analysis showing up to 89% of taxpayers in some regional and suburban Coalition electorates will be better off.  About 85% of taxpayers in Liberal and National electorates will be better off under Labor’s plan than stage three, or 3.4 million people out of a total of 4 million, according to analysis released by the office of the treasurer, Jim Chalmers.  In opposition leader Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson, the analysis found 85% of taxpayers would be better off under Labor’s plan than the stage-three tax cuts legislated by the Coalition.  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has accused the Coalition of being “all over the shop” on the tax plan because the opposition is yet to say if it will support changes designed to help low- and middle-income earners.  The top five Coalition electorates to benefit, with 89% of taxpayers better off, are: Liberal-held Forde and Longman in Brisbane; Nationals-held Page and Cowper in northern New South Wales; and Braddon in Tasmania.  Some 88% of taxpayers are better off in the next five Coalition seats to benefit: Wright and Hinkler in Queensland; La Trobe in Victoria; and Lindsay and Lyne in NSW.  The statistics echo findings of an analysis by the Australian National University associate professor Ben Phillips, that working-class communities in Coalition-held remote and regional electorates stand to gain the most.  The Coalition has been subtly repositioning on the tax changes, backtracking from outright opposition to suggesting that the opposition could keep low- and middle-income tax cuts and propose at the next election to fully implement stage three by abolishing the 37% tax bracket.  00:03:33 Anthony Albanese announces revised stage-three tax cuts – video  On Tuesday Dutton continued to prevaricate on the tax cuts, saying shadow cabinet had not reached a final position. He criticised Labor plans to give back $28bn less over 10 years than the Coalition’s legislated package.  The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, told the ABC the Coalition’s “starting point” was that “no Australian should get less than they were promised under stage three”.  The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Sky News that the “guiding principle” of both Coalition parties was “that we want to give as much of your tax dollar back to you as we possibly can”.  The comments suggest the Coalition will seek to amend Labor’s bill to restore cuts for high-income earners, but could opt to not to oppose cuts for those lower down the scale.  While Labor pressures the Coalition, the Greens are warning that the plan to increase tax relief for those earning less than $146,486 still excludes those on the lowest incomes, including those receiving government payments or earning below the $18,200 tax-free threshold.  The Greens have released a Parliamentary Budget Office analysis showing that in the first year just $1.8bn out of the total $23.3bn cost will go to the poorest 40% of households.  The top 20% of households will still pocket $11.7bn that year, despite Labor’s plan halving the tax cut for those earning more than $190,000 from $9,000 to $4,500.  Over a decade, people earning more than $180,000 will still receive $84bn of tax cuts, more than a quarter of the cost of the package.  Albanese has said the package “overwhelmingly benefits” and is “aimed at middle Australia”.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 85% of taxpayers in Liberal and National electorates will be better off under Labor’s plan than stage three, or 3.4 million people out of a total of 4 million, according to analysis released by the office of the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. In opposition leader Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson, the analysis found 85% of taxpayers would be better off under Labor’s plan than the stage-three tax cuts legislated by the Coalition. Working-class communities in Coalition-held seats the biggest winners in Labor’s stage-three tax cuts overhaul Read more The prime minister, Anthony Albanese , has accused the Coalition of being “all over the shop” on the tax plan because the opposition is yet to say if it will support changes designed to help low- and middle-income earners. The top five Coalition electorates to benefit, with 89% of taxpayers better off, are: Liberal-held Forde and Longman in Brisbane; Nationals-held Page and Cowper in northern New South Wales; and Braddon in Tasmania. Some 88% of taxpayers are better off in the next five Coalition seats to benefit: Wright and Hinkler in Queensland; La Trobe in Victoria; and Lindsay and Lyne in NSW. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The statistics echo findings of an analysis by the Australian National University associate professor Ben Phillips , that working-class communities in Coalition-held remote and regional electorates stand to gain the most. The Coalition has been subtly repositioning on the tax changes, backtracking from outright opposition to suggesting that the opposition could keep low- and middle-income tax cuts and propose at the next election to fully implement stage three by abolishing the 37% tax bracket. 00:03:33 Anthony Albanese announces revised stage-three tax cuts – video On Tuesday Dutton continued to prevaricate on the tax cuts, saying shadow cabinet had not reached a final position. He criticised Labor plans to give back $28bn less over 10 years than the Coalition’s legislated package. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, told the ABC the Coalition’s “starting point” was that “no Australian should get less than they were promised under stage three”. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Sky News that the “guiding principle” of both Coalition parties was “that we want to give as much of your tax dollar back to you as we possibly can”. The comments suggest the Coalition will seek to amend Labor’s bill to restore cuts for high-income earners, but could opt to not to oppose cuts for those lower down the scale. While Labor pressures the Coalition, the Greens are warning that the plan to increase tax relief for those earning less than $146,486 still excludes those on the lowest incomes, including those receiving government payments or earning below the $18,200 tax-free threshold. The Greens have released a Parliamentary Budget Office analysis showing that in the first year just $1.8bn out of the total $23.3bn cost will go to the poorest 40% of households. The top 20% of households will still pocket $11.7bn that year, despite Labor’s plan halving the tax cut for those earning more than $190,000 from $9,000 to $4,500. Over a decade, people earning more than $180,000 will still receive $84bn of tax cuts, more than a quarter of the cost of the package. Albanese has said the package “overwhelmingly benefits” and is “aimed at middle Australia”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group, who include the former foreign ministers Bob Carr and Gareth Evans, is urging the Albanese government to play an “activist middle power” role to reduce tensions between Australia’s top security ally and its biggest trading partner.  In a statement published on Wednesday, the prominent Australians said they were “apprehensive these tensions may lead to direct military conflict, which would risk dragging Australia into war”.  “We support a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region in which the United States and China respect and recognise each other as equals,” said the group, who also include the Nobel laureate Peter Doherty and the former Liberal ministers Fred Chaney and Ian Macphee.  “A commitment from both sides to cooperative security, in which neither side demands absolute primacy – a new detente – is the key to reducing threats to both regional and global peace and prosperity.”  This detente – an easing of hostility or strained relations – “would be comparable to the accommodation negotiated in the 1970s between the United States and the USSR by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev”, the group said.  The signatories to Wednesday’s statement include the former South Australian premier Mike Rann, the former Western Australia premier Carmen Lawrence, the former Greens leader Bob Brown and the social justice advocate Tim Costello.  They argued the proposal was “not about pacifism or appeasement” but “a sensible effort to ensure peace and prosperity in our region” in cooperation with other countries.  They acknowledged, however, that such an outcome would “not be easily or immediately achievable in the current climate”.  “Australia can contribute to changing that environment by renewing our commitment to an activist middle power diplomacy, conducted in close consultation with our key Indo-Pacific neighbours, which advocates respect for international law and universal human rights, focuses on risk reduction, and strongly discourages the use of force in resolving territorial and other international disputes,” they said.  Others appealing for detente include the publishing figure Louise Adler, former Socceroo Craig Foster, the English-Australian actor Miriam Margolyes and the legal academic Larissa Behrendt.  They said potential benefits of a US-China detente included “relaxation of general political and military tensions with the opportunity to sharply reduce military spending through arms control agreements – and to enable a return to mutually beneficial free and open trade”.  The statement also advocated “de-escalation of tensions over Taiwan with acceptance by both sides of the need for open-ended commitment to the cross-strait status quo”.  Taiwan remains one of the most sensitive issues in the relationship between the US and China, with Beijing declaring the self-governed democracy is an inherent part of its territory.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

8,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/activist-ben-pennings-adani-lawsuit-carmichael-coalmine,"Lawyers for the environmental activist Ben Pennings say the long-running case against him brought by the mining company Adani should be thrown out as an “abuse of process”, telling the Queensland supreme court the remaining claims are “embarrassing”, “incredibly weak” and “highly problematic”.  Adani, which operates in Australia as Bravus, first sued Pennings in 2020, alleging he had sought to disrupt the operations of the Carmichael coalmine, its suppliers and contractors.  The activist’s barrister, Michael Hodge KC, told a hearing in Brisbane on Monday that Adani had already abandoned the “primary cause of action” in its case against Pennings, when last year it dropped claims he unlawfully accessed confidential information.  Justice Susan Brown is now considering an application to strike out Adani’s amended statement of claim, which alleges Pennings engaged in intimidation and conspiracy, and that he had induced employees to breach their contracts.  The miner, a subsidiary of the controversial Indian conglomerate, claims it suffered a financial loss after two companies, Greyhound and Downer, withdrew from contracts to provide services to the Carmichael mine.  Hodge told the court that Adani’s claim – that these contracts collapsed due to specific “demands and threats” by Pennings – was not supported by any contemporaneous evidence.  He said the case was “highly problematic” and amounted to an abuse of process because Adani had made and maintained claims about the loss of those contracts that bear “no resemblance” to any evidence it had disclosed.  Claims that threats by Pennings had caused companies to withdraw from contracts were “inconsistent” with public statements made by Greyhound and Downer, including a statement by Downer to the Australian Stock Exchange in 2017, Hodge said.  Both Downer and Adani have said publicly they agreed to terminate their contract in 2017, with Adani citing the Queensland government’s decision to veto a potential loan to the miner under the northern Australia infrastructure facility. Adani said the loan veto meant it would be cheaper to run the mine as an owner-operator.  An affidavit tendered in evidence attests to comments made by Downer’s former chairman Michael Harding that the company “had to make a choice between Adani and every other party Downer was working with” due to the threat of activists targeting its operations.  Greyhound said publicly it had decided to withdraw after receiving messages, emails and phone calls about its involvement with the project. The court heard Greyhound had sent a letter to Adani citing a Guardian Australia article that had first revealed the company’s contract.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its barrister, Graham Gibson KC, said there was a “sufficient factual foundation” to support the pleading and that it ought not be struck out.  He said Adani’s case was that demands and threats by Pennings were “the source of protest activity” targeting Adani contractors.  “The pleading of causation in the statement of claim is not deficient, nor is it uncertain,” Gibson said.  He said Hodge’s criticisms of Adani’s pleading had been “expanded out of all proportion” and were “ultimately if not a contrivance, an exaggeration”.  In relation to claims of conspiracy, Adani’s claim alleges the involvement of “unknown conspirators”.  Gibson said the pleadings did not contain “direct evidence” of an agreement or understanding between Pennings and others to harm Adani but that such a conspiracy “is clearly to be inferred from the facts”.  The case was launched in 2020 after an unsuccessful application by Adani to search Pennings’ home.  Court documents in that case detailed that Adani hired a private investigator to surveil the activist and his family members, including taking photographs of him walking his then nine-year-old daughter to school.  The case has now been running for more than three years. Legal sources say it is highly unusual for a case not to progress beyond pleadings in that time. Both sides have publicly blamed one another for delays and Adani has said it always intended to adjust its pleadings following the discovery process.  Pennings is also applying to lift an injunction that has been in place throughout the case, and for the reversal of a costs order imposed on him by the court after an earlier hearing.  The hearing continues.","‘Abuse of process’: activist Ben Pennings seeks to have Adani case thrown out of court | Queensland | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian Support the Guardian Fund independent journalism with $5 per month Support us Support us News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development More Environmental activist Ben Pennings outside the Brisbane supreme court in 2021.

An affidavit tendered in evidence attests to comments made by Downer’s former chairman Michael Harding that the company “had to make a choice between Adani and every other party Downer was working with” due to the threat of activists targeting its operations. Greyhound said publicly it had decided to withdraw after receiving messages, emails and phone calls about its involvement with the project. The court heard Greyhound had sent a letter to Adani citing a Guardian Australia article that had first revealed the company’s contract. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its barrister, Graham Gibson KC, said there was a “sufficient factual foundation” to support the pleading and that it ought not be struck out. He said Adani’s case was that demands and threats by Pennings were “the source of protest activity” targeting Adani contractors. “The pleading of causation in the statement of claim is not deficient, nor is it uncertain,” Gibson said. He said Hodge’s criticisms of Adani’s pleading had been “expanded out of all proportion” and were “ultimately if not a contrivance, an exaggeration”. In relation to claims of conspiracy, Adani’s claim alleges the involvement of “unknown conspirators”. Gibson said the pleadings did not contain “direct evidence” of an agreement or understanding between Pennings and others to harm Adani but that such a conspiracy “is clearly to be inferred from the facts”. The case was launched in 2020 after an unsuccessful application by Adani to search Pennings’ home. Court documents in that case detailed that Adani hired a private investigator to surveil the activist and his family members, including taking photographs of him walking his then nine-year-old daughter to school. The case has now been running for more than three years. Legal sources say it is highly unusual for a case not to progress beyond pleadings in that time. Both sides have publicly blamed one another for delays and Adani has said it always intended to adjust its pleadings following the discovery process. Pennings is also applying to lift an injunction that has been in place throughout the case, and for the reversal of a costs order imposed on him by the court after an earlier hearing. The hearing continues.

2,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/millions-of-australians-at-risk-of-being-stung-by-fire-ants-each-year-experts-warn,"Fire ants could sting 8.6 million Australians a year if they were to become endemic – but a pathogenic fungus and pesticide-loaded drones might help avert that scenario, according to submissions posed to the federal government’s fire ants inquiry.  Submissions to the Senate inquiry into red imported fire ants (Rifa) in Australia closed on Monday, just days after the latest in a string of fire ant detections beyond south-east Queensland, where an infestation of the invasive pest is ongoing.  Last week a single fire ant was found in an Australia Post package of plant material sent to Tasmania from Queensland. The non-reproductive female was detected by Biosecurity Tasmania as part of “business-as-usual surveillance operations at mail centres across the state”.  In late January a fire ant nest was found in Wardell in northern New South Wales, while five nests were discovered in Murwillumbah, 13km south of the Queensland border, in November. It was the first time fire ants had crossed the Queensland border into NSW since the infestation began in 2001.  The fire ants’ march south has prompted a range of government, agricultural, health and research bodies and individuals to use the inquiry to call for resources and education to help stamp out the pest. Fire ant stings can cause anaphylaxis and death in humans. They can also damage electrical and agricultural equipment, kill native plants and damage ecosystems beyond repair.  In a joint submission to the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee, the National Allergy Centre of Excellence and Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia predicted that if fire ants were to become endemic, a quarter of the 8.6 million Australians who would be stung by fire ants each year would develop an allergic reaction, with 174,000 of those requiring medical attention.  Up to 652,000 people a year would seek medical consultation because of Rifa stings, they said.  The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy said “anaphylaxis is almost three times more common with Rifa stings than with other stinging insects”.  In 2021 927 people were hospitalised after a bee sting and there were 12 deaths from wasps and bees, with 1% of bee stings causing anaphylaxis. That figure rises to 2.8% for fire ant stings, according to the society.  “Therefore, if Rifa became endemic in Australia it is likely that hospitalisations and deaths due to stinging insects would significantly increase,” it said.  The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation told the committee that it was developing RNA-interference management tools that target fire ants, silencing their genes to kill or reduce reproductive potential. It is proposing laboratory-based risk assessments of a pathogenic microsporidium, or fungus, and a virus capable of killing entire fire ant colonies.  It is also researching the use of drones for biosecurity, including for the application of fire ant pesticide.  Dr Anthony Young, a senior lecturer in crop protection at the University of Queensland, described what he called the “failures” of the national red imported fire ant eradication program after a fire ant nest was detected and reported in Karana Downs, Queensland.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/australia-corruption-ranking-whistleblowers-transparency-international,"Australia’s reputation on corruption has remained steady in the latest world rankings but the Albanese government has been urged to do more to protect whistleblowers.  The annual corruption perceptions index, released by Transparency International on Tuesday, has placed Australia at 14th, maintaining its score of 75 out of 100. It uses expert views to rate countries on possible corruption in public services.  Australia also received a score of 75 last year, improving on the prior year’s record-low of 73 points. The minor bump in score still falls short of the country’s high of 85 in 2012.  The anti-corruption group’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, said the Albanese government’s opening of the national anti-corruption commission and promises of electoral reform laid “promising foundations” but “there’s a new chapter waiting to be written in 2024”.  “Australia can become a global leader in the fight against corruption,” he said. “This means reducing the influence of big money in politics, delivering on whistleblower protections, and passing long-overdue legislation to crack down on foreign bribery and money laundering.”  In the Asia-Pacific region, New Zealand topped the list with a score of 85, followed by Singapore at 83. Hong Kong stayed on par with Australia at 75.  The region’s average score for the 31 countries measured in the index was 45.  Transparency International Australia’s chair and integrity expert, Prof A J Brown, said whistleblower protections was one area Australia could do more on.  The federal government is in the middle of consultations on further public interest disclosure reforms, including whether whistleblowers should be protected while gathering evidence before disclosing possible wrongdoing, the need for a standalone whistleblower protection authority, and a financial reward system for those coming forward.  Brown said the Labor government and its attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, had a real opportunity to overhaul the issues in one go.  The existing federal whistleblower protections only extend to those working within, or directly for, the public sector. Brown said there should be a more holistic approach to protect those in the private sector as well.  “It’s unfortunately not enough to just go back a decade to 2013 and try and tweak a federal whistleblower protection law for the public sector,” Brown said.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/black-summer-bushfires-australia-tourism-industry-impact,"As Australia headed into the summer of late 2019, Craig Wickham’s tour company Exceptional Kangaroo Island was doing better than ever.  Founded in 1990, it was on track to hit $3m in annual revenue for the first time.  “It was as good as the business had ever been,” Wickham says. “We were flying.” .  Instead, by early 2020, more than a third of Kangaroo Island, off the South Australian coast, was up in flames as what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires tore through forests around the country.  Wickham, a volunteer firefighter, closed the business for eight days. The cancellations from Europe, the US and Canada started rolling in.  “We lost about half a million dollars in the first week,” Wickham says. There were big parts of the spectacular island unaffected but many tourists still cancelled months in advance.  The economic impact of the fires on Australia’s tourism industry would soon be forgotten. The country’s borders closed on 20 March that year to try to hold off a global pandemic.  But a new study published on Wednesday from the University of Sydney estimates the black summer bushfires impacts on tourism ripped $2.8bn almost instantly from the country’s economy.  The estimate, published in the journal Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, compared government tourism data from the previous year with the revenue from January, February and March 2020 while the fires were burning.  The study also accounted for the knock-on effects to the economy through the tourism supply chain, rather than just the loss of revenue.  Wickham’s business, for example, pays bills to almost 200 different companies or sole traders in the course of a year.  “That’s why it’s important that we look at the entire supply chain,” says Vivienne Reiner, a researcher at the university’s Integrated Sustainability Analysis centre, who led the study.  Reiner says the impacts on tourism were widespread and seen even in areas relatively unaffected by the fires. And the study’s findings only show the cost to one part of the Australian economy.  One report suggested the country’s agricultural sector, for example, took a hit of between $4bn and $5bn from the black summer bushfires, with most of that figure representing direct losses to crops and livestock.

Photograph: Paul’s Place Wildlife Sanctuary/Reuters  There has already been an increase in the number of days in Australia where the risk of fire is higher, and fires are also burning larger areas. As global heating continues, climate models suggest the risks will rise even further.  Global heating is affecting other extremes with increasing trends in the kind of downpours that can cause flash flooding, exacerbated by rising sea levels at the coasts.  A 2022 report commissioned by the Insurance Council of Australia on the costs of extreme weather found the value of annual insurance claims had doubled since the period 1986 to 2005.  At the same time, the report said the federal government budget spending on disasters between 2005 and 2022 was heavily skewed to reacting to events – $24bn was spent on disaster relief but just $0.5bn was spent on “future-proofing and disaster resilience”.  The council says since black summer, insurers have paid out $16bn in claims from 13 declared insurance catastrophes or significant events.  But as the insurance council report noted, costs “do not reflect the full value of the personal economic loss” and, as the frequency and severity of extreme events rises, the report said: “The cost to government will increase alongside the cost of insurance claims.”  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Models used by government to estimate costs are based on past events, Lenzen says. And this is a problem if current and future events are unprecedented.  “If we’re entering a severely shocked world from climate change, we don’t have observations from the past to give us a full picture of how households and businesses respond.”  Dr Karl Mallon, the chief executive of Climate Risk Group that analyses the costs and risks from global heating, says global warming is making hidden costs from natural disasters worse. He points to the health costs of inhaling bushfire smoke, the mental health toll, the inflation in rebuild costs due to demand for labour and materials; and the loss of jobs when businesses close up for good and how that cascades through the supply chain.  “Some of these costs are hard to put your finger on, but we do know about them,” he says.  One of Mallon’s biggest concerns is if insurers in Australia follow the lead of insurers in the US, where the risk of wildfire and rising rebuild costs is seeing insurers refusing to write policies in California.

Exclusive: The impact on businesses was widespread, even in areas relatively unaffected by the disaster, study finds Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast Graham Readfearn @readfearn Tue 30 Jan 2024 14.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 30 Jan 2024 21.17 GMT As Australia headed into the summer of late 2019, Craig Wickham’s tour company Exceptional Kangaroo Island was doing better than ever. Founded in 1990, it was on track to hit $3m in annual revenue for the first time. “It was as good as the business had ever been,” Wickham says. “We were flying.” . AI cameras reveal the survival stories of Australian animals after bushfires Read more Instead, by early 2020, more than a third of Kangaroo Island, off the South Australian coast, was up in flames as what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires tore through forests around the country. Wickham, a volunteer firefighter, closed the business for eight days. The cancellations from Europe, the US and Canada started rolling in. “We lost about half a million dollars in the first week,” Wickham says. There were big parts of the spectacular island unaffected but many tourists still cancelled months in advance. The economic impact of the fires on Australia’s tourism industry would soon be forgotten. The country’s borders closed on 20 March that year to try to hold off a global pandemic. But a new study published on Wednesday from the University of Sydney estimates the black summer bushfires impacts on tourism ripped $2.8bn almost instantly from the country’s economy. The estimate, published in the journal Economics of Disasters and Climate Change , compared government tourism data from the previous year with the revenue from January, February and March 2020 while the fires were burning. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The study also accounted for the knock-on effects to the economy through the tourism supply chain, rather than just the loss of revenue. Wickham’s business, for example, pays bills to almost 200 different companies or sole traders in the course of a year. “That’s why it’s important that we look at the entire supply chain,” says Vivienne Reiner, a researcher at the university’s Integrated Sustainability Analysis centre, who led the study. Reiner says the impacts on tourism were widespread and seen even in areas relatively unaffected by the fires. And the study’s findings only show the cost to one part of the Australian economy . One report suggested the country’s agricultural sector , for example, took a hit of between $4bn and $5bn from the black summer bushfires, with most of that figure representing direct losses to crops and livestock.

Photograph: Paul’s Place Wildlife Sanctuary/Reuters There has already been an increase in the number of days in Australia where the risk of fire is higher, and fires are also burning larger areas . As global heating continues, climate models suggest the risks will rise even further . Global heating is affecting other extremes with increasing trends in the kind of downpours that can cause flash flooding, exacerbated by rising sea levels at the coasts. A 2022 report commissioned by the Insurance Council of Australia on the costs of extreme weather found the value of annual insurance claims had doubled since the period 1986 to 2005. At the same time, the report said the federal government budget spending on disasters between 2005 and 2022 was heavily skewed to reacting to events – $24bn was spent on disaster relief but just $0.5bn was spent on “future-proofing and disaster resilience”. The council says since black summer, insurers have paid out $16bn in claims from 13 declared insurance catastrophes or significant events. But as the insurance council report noted, costs “do not reflect the full value of the personal economic loss” and, as the frequency and severity of extreme events rises, the report said: “The cost to government will increase alongside the cost of insurance claims.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Models used by government to estimate costs are based on past events, Lenzen says. And this is a problem if current and future events are unprecedented. “If we’re entering a severely shocked world from climate change, we don’t have observations from the past to give us a full picture of how households and businesses respond.” Dr Karl Mallon, the chief executive of Climate Risk Group that analyses the costs and risks from global heating, says global warming is making hidden costs from natural disasters worse. He points to the health costs of inhaling bushfire smoke, the mental health toll, the inflation in rebuild costs due to demand for labour and materials; and the loss of jobs when businesses close up for good and how that cascades through the supply chain. “Some of these costs are hard to put your finger on, but we do know about them,” he says. One of Mallon’s biggest concerns is if insurers in Australia follow the lead of insurers in the US, where the risk of wildfire and rising rebuild costs is seeing insurers refusing to write policies in California . Because mortgages required home insurance, Mallon says “imagine the collapse in [property] value … it would be immense”.

Australia's consumer rights watchdog saw a sharp rise in scam reports mentioning Booking.com in 2023, which led to Australians losing more than $337,000. Criminals have gained access to the Booking.com accounts of some accommodation providers, using them to send messages to guests while posing as properties they have bookings with.  Criminals have gained access to the Booking.com accounts of some accommodation providers, using them to send messages to guests while posing as properties they have bookings with. What's next? The scam is still occurring. The ACCC says Booking.com users should contact properties directly by phone, and be suspicious of links in messages and emails.  Australia's consumer rights watchdog has seen a sharp increase in Australians mentioning popular accommodation site Booking.com when they report experiencing or falling victim to a scam.  Scam reports mentioning Booking.com significantly increased in 2023 and caused Australians to lose more than $337,000, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).  The ACCC said its Scamwatch program received 363 reports of scams in 2023 which mentioned Booking.com — one of the most visited travel booking sites in the world.  That's almost a 600 per cent increase on 2022, during which only 53 reported scams made reference to Booking.com.  Booking.com scam 'very legitimate looking', victim says  Queensland resident Robyn, who requested to only be identified by her first name, told ABC News that she received a message through Booking.com in January 2023, which appeared to be from a hotel in Istanbul, Türkiye, where she had an upcoming booking.  Robyn said the message claimed her booking would be cancelled if she did not confirm her payment details. She clicked a link included in the message, which took her to a site that appeared to be Booking.com, as it contained the details of her trip and its costs.  An example of a scam message received from a hotel through Booking.com, sent by scammers. ( ABC News )  ""It was very legitimate looking, it was so good,"" Robyn says.  ""It was very confusing, and so convoluted … It all looked so real.""  Ironically, after providing her credit card details, Robyn said she was warned her card couldn't be used due to ""security purposes"". She said she entered the details of a second card but was told it also could not be accepted, and was asked to make a bank transfer.  Realising this was suspicious, Robyn messaged the hotel through Booking.com, unaware that the messages were under the control of cybercriminals.  ""I had a conversation with people that I thought were in the hotel,"" she says. ""I got very angry, and they then became very aggressive with me.""  Robyn said a legitimate representative from the hotel eventually called her directly with the grim news.  ""The hotel said that their system through Booking.com had been basically hijacked,"" she says. ""They could see me talking to people, but it wasn't them.  ""They said they couldn't get into the system to tell me to stop talking to them.""  Robyn's Istanbul hotel did not respond to a request for comment.  Booking.com says criminals have impersonated accommodation providers through direct messages sent through its platform. ( Reuters: Dado Ruvic )  Within an hour after her credit card details were stolen, Robyn said her bank contacted her about a suspicious transaction on her account — a hotel booking in Budapest, Hungary, made through Booking.com.  When she contacted the Budapest hotel to warn them, Robyn said she was told the venue had already cancelled the booking because it was made by a man with a French accent, a Portuguese name and an English address.  An example of a scam message received from a hotel through Booking.com, sent by scammers. ( ABC News )  Robyn said the hotel told her that scammers sometimes used stolen cards to make bookings, before cancelling them and requesting a refund onto a different card or bank account.  In total, Robyn said her cards were used for a handful of accommodation bookings totalling around $25,000. Luckily, her bank would later return the funds.  Robyn said when she contacted Booking.com about the fraud, the company's customer service team appeared ""uninterested"".  ""I said, 'Your system has been hacked … I was talking to these people through your system.' And they were just really unhelpful and didn't care,"" she said.  Booking.com told ABC News that a number of its accommodation partners had been targeted by phishing emails ""sent by professional criminals, with the intent of taking over their local computer systems with malware"".  ""In some cases this has led to unauthorised access of their Booking.com account, which enables these fraudsters to temporarily impersonate the accommodation and communicate with guests via email or messages,"" a spokesperson said.  ""It's important to highlight that Booking.com's back-end systems and infrastructure have not been breached, and the number of accommodations impacted are a small fraction of those on our platform.  ""At the same time, we understand the importance of keeping the data we are entrusted with secure. That's why we continue to make significant investments to limit the impact and have put new measures and alerts in place to update and protect our customers, as well as our accommodation partners.""  Despite Booking.com's efforts, the scam continues to impact accommodation providers across the world — this reporter even received a scam message from an accommodation provider on Booking.com while writing this story.  Booking.com says customers should report any suspicious messages to the company's customer service team, check the payment policy associated with their booking, and be careful not to share their credit card details over email, text message or on instant messaging platforms.  The company, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, said it had over 2.7 million properties on its website by the end of 2022, including more than 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts.  The ACCC says Booking.com users should independently verify any emails or messages they receive through the website. ( Reuters: Pascal Rossignol )  Travellers warned to be vigilant  The ACCC says Booking.com users should protect themselves from phishing scams, like the one experienced by Robyn, by trying to independently verify any emails or messages they receive which include a link or ask for personal or banking information.  Verifying usually involves contacting the accommodation provider directly using a phone number from their official website — and not one provided in an email or Booking.com message.  ""Be aware that Booking.com customer service representatives won't ask you to provide your account password or financial information such as a credit card over the phone,"" the ACCC says.  In its advice to accommodation providers which use its property management platform Extranet, Booking.com says provider accounts ""can be a tempting target for cybercriminals and fraudsters"", as they contain ""a large amount of guest data, including names, addresses, credit card details, and phone numbers"".  ""Fraudsters may attempt to mimic our emails in order to phish your username and password for the purposes of taking over your account,"" Booking.com says.  ""These phishing emails can lead to a webpage that looks very similar to the Booking.com Extranet login page — but if you look at the URL address bar, you'll notice differences.""  Booking.com says it disables the ability for properties to include links in their messages to guests if suspicious activity is detected on their account.  Robyn said she would be more vigilant with her travel bookings in the future.  ""Would I get caught like that again? No,"" she said.  ""Have I booked through Booking.com again?

7,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/vape-stores-concentrated-around-schools-and-socioeconomically-disadvantaged-suburbs-australian-study-finds,"Vape stores are concentrated around schools and in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, Australian researchers have shown for the first time in an audit of dedicated shops in Western Australia.  The study led by researchers from the University of Notre Dame Australia and published on Wednesday in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health found almost nine out of 10 vape stores were within walking distance of schools.  The researchers also found vape store density was nearly seven times higher in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas compared with wealthier suburbs.  The researchers identified 194 dedicated e-cigarette retailers in WA after manually searching the internet and social media, and measured their proximity to 1,144 government, independent and Catholic schools.  They found approximately one in three vape stores were located within 500m of a school and 88% were located within 1km of a school.  The study focused on brick-and-mortar vape stores because of their overt advertising of vaping products and because evidence shows that first-time exposure to vape products often occurs in a physical retailer setting.  The researchers said because the audit findings focused only on dedicated vape stores, they underestimate the total number of e-cigarette retailers in the state, which can also include convenience stores and independent supermarkets.  Prof Lisa Wood, a senior author of the paper from the Institute for Health Research at Notre Dame University, said the study was the first of its kind to look comprehensively at the relationship between vape store location and area of disadvantage, as well as the first state-wide study in Australia to look at proximity of bricks-and-mortar vape stores to schools.  Because there is no public registry of vape stores in WA, unlike for tobacco retailers which have a licensing scheme, Wood said: “We have to be vigilant in keeping an eye on the landscape of vape stores.”  The study’s finding of 159 dedicated vape stores in Perth represents an increase of 120% since a previous audit of vape stores in the city in 2019 identified 72 retailers across vape shops, tobacconists or smoke shops.  Exclusive data obtained by Guardian Australia in November showed that more than 600 vape stores had opened in New South Wales in the first half of 2023 despite the federal government announcing tough reforms that will ban sales from convenience stores.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

0,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/aboriginal-children-stranded-uk-without-passports-ms-m-mr-l,"Two Aboriginal children who have been stranded in the UK without passports or visas since 2020 while courts decided their guardianship must be immediately brought home to Australia, the nation’s peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children says.  The chief executive of SNAICC, Catherine Liddle, said it “beggared belief” that any government agency would allow vulnerable children to be “trapped in limbo” as “unwanted aliens in a distant country, with no family or cultural links”.  “The fact they are in the UK in the first place is yet another demonstration of how child protection systems are failing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families,” Liddle said. “These Aboriginal children should be in their country, with their family and community, maintaining their connection to culture.”  The complex and long-running case involves two Aboriginal children, a boy and a girl aged 14 and 15, who have been in the care of the New South Wales minister for communities and justice since they were removed from their Wiradjuri mother in 2010.  In December 2017 the children were fostered by a couple, British citizens referred to in court proceedings as Ms M and Mr L, after living for a time with their maternal aunt.  In June 2019 Mr L’s visa expired and he returned to England. Ms M’s visa expired the following August. With the minister’s consent, she travelled to England with the children on the understanding they would all return by October that same year. But their flight was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and they have remained in the UK ever since.  Prior to the children’s departure, their mother sought to be returned parental responsibility and to have contact with them, but in 2022 the NSW children’s court decided they could remain in the care of their UK foster parents. The court said the minister would remain responsible for the children’s contact with their Aboriginal families and connection to their cultural background.  Their mother successfully appealed that decision, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to make orders about children who were living overseas. In granting her appeal, the judges said it was unclear how contact with the child’s Aboriginal families could occur, “given that the children were living in the UK and were expected to remain there”.  Their mother was awarded parental responsibility in December last year. But the children remain in the UK, where the eldest is now in the UK child protection system. Guardian Australia understands the foster carers also wish to relinquish care of the younger child to the UK system.  The Coalition spokesperson for child protection, senator Kerrynne Liddle, said the case showed the human services system was in crisis “in every jurisdiction” and called on the federal government to resolve the matter urgently.  “The Albanese government has known about this since before Christmas. It should have been a priority for them and it must be,” she said. “This is a sensitive issue but it must be sorted out in Australia with appropriate supports to enable the best possible outcome for the children in both the short and long term.”  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

1,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-31/what-you-need-to-know-about-parking-apps/103405850,"Parking, and the enormous amount of space we cede to it, is undergoing two revolutions.  The first is the rise of parking apps. The second is a reckoning with whether we really need so much parking, and what else we could do with all that space.  In the middle of both revolutions sit drivers. Apps like EasyPark, CellOPark and PayStay promise efficiency through pay-as-you-go parking, adjusted to the minute and location via a smartphone app.  Drivers avoid the fuss of meters and overpaid or overrun tickets, and parking operators get easy-to-monitor databases. Meanwhile, app providers take a handsome per-session fee in the order of 5–12 per cent, depending on the provider.  Councils and campuses have been sold the trick, festooning parking signs with QR codes, ""parking is changing"" declarations, and discreet signals of outsourced responsibility.  But who is behind these apps? Are we getting a good bargain? And what does it mean for us and our cities?  Rise of the parking apps  Parking apps have been around since the 2000s, with the Australian market picking up strongly in the past five years. Three of the most common apps are EasyPark, CellOPark and PayStay. In New South Wales, there is also a government-backed app, Park'nPay.  EasyPark is a Scandinavian export, now owned by private equity firm Vitruvian Partners. Tactically, EasyPark Australia's spread through a city can feel like a stack of dominoes. In Perth, the app popped up in a string of outer councils before closing in on the prized centres of Stirling and Perth.  Encircled by EasyPark's magenta signs, the service's most recent adoptee is the University of Western Australia (the author's home institution). Their competitor CellOPark didn't get a look in, despite operating in the state for over a decade, including just down the road at Curtin University.  Australian-headquartered CellOPark services over 75 per cent of Australian universities offering a parking app. Its service fee is 6 per cent to EasyPark's 11.5 per cent, and it integrates directly with university authentication systems.  Terms of the bargain  App providers deserve payment as much as the next business. But parking apps strike deals that go beyond convenience, so we need to assess them fully and transparently.  The NSW Department of Customer Service recently learned this when it was slammed by NSW’s Auditor-General for dealings with Duncan Solutions (developer of Park'nPay). The auditor cited no evidence of “value for money” and a rushed procurement process.  There are several key considerations. The first — parking apps generate honey pots of detailed information on people and their movements. This presents new privacy costs and risks, as experienced by EasyPark's European customers when home addresses, phone numbers, emails, scrambled passwords and partial financial information were stolen in a December 2023 hack. (The company claims no parking data was accessed in the breach.)  Those wanting to offer parking apps must determine precisely what data the apps collect, where it goes and what is done with it. They should conduct thorough risk assessments on potential data misuse. Preferably apps should maintain customer and location information encrypted and on-device, reducing the risk of improper third-party access.  Second, we need proper ""value for money"" assessments to address how parking apps cut into public revenue without significantly reducing costs (parking inspectors still patrol, and digital meters still need maintenance). Councils and campuses must publicly justify the trade-off — money paid to app providers reduces budgets for building public amenities or supporting core business.  In sum, there should be complete, public assessment of the financial, privacy, access and inclusion implications of adopting parking apps. To prevent underhanded dealing, councils and campuses should also enable open competition between apps, as Mosman Council has done in Sydney.  Streets tightly lined with parked cars is a common sight in many Australian suburbs. ( ABC News: Scott Jewell )  Parking is primal and paradoxical  Beyond data privacy and revenue implications, there is a more fundamental matter. Parking apps have a vested interest in an abundance of parking, it's their core business.  But one of the most significant economic and environmental revolutions underway in cities is a radical reassessment of what we've sacrificed in pursuit of parking.  If we want long-term thinking about how to rescue and reimagine cities, we need to think beyond the apps.  In the past two decades, urban planning scholars have revealed a number of stunning truths about drivers and cities. Landmark Australian research and books show that parking is primal and paradoxical.  Every driver feels they deserve ""rockstar"" parking, ideally right at their destination, secure and free — and they're aggrieved if they can't have it. Behind the wheel, we assume a universal impatience, intolerance and entitlement. It simmers above the unspoken anxiety of not being able to park.  Since the 1950s, cities have been defined by their valiant efforts to cater to these base instincts.  We have paved them with car parks, relinquishing wetlands, parklands and foreshores. We have foregone housing and public amenities, all to ensure optimal storage of high-emissions private property.  Superficially, better managing the supply of parking presents a perfect union with parking apps. Real-time management is just the kind of technocratic petri dish where apps love to breed.  Yet scratch the surface and you'll find the apps are locking in the status quo. They further subordinate people and places to the primacy of parking.  The great paradox is that while parking is both objectively abundant and an exorbitant tax on everyone, no driver is satisfied. So we build more parking, and download more apps, and our cities become less liveable.

Councils and campuses have been sold the trick, festooning parking signs with QR codes, ""parking is changing"" declarations, and discreet signals of outsourced responsibility. But who is behind these apps? Are we getting a good bargain? And what does it mean for us and our cities? Rise of the parking apps Parking apps have been around since the 2000s, with the Australian market picking up strongly in the past five years. Three of the most common apps are EasyPark, CellOPark and PayStay. In New South Wales, there is also a government-backed app, Park'nPay . We all love free car parking — but who's really paying for it? We all love free car parking, but it has a hidden cost — and you pay for it even if you don't drive. Read more EasyPark is a Scandinavian export , now owned by private equity firm Vitruvian Partners . Tactically, EasyPark Australia's spread through a city can feel like a stack of dominoes. In Perth, the app popped up in a string of outer councils before closing in on the prized centres of Stirling and Perth . Encircled by EasyPark's magenta signs, the service's most recent adoptee is the University of Western Australia (the author's home institution). Their competitor CellOPark didn't get a look in, despite operating in the state for over a decade , including just down the road at Curtin University. Australian-headquartered CellOPark services over 75 per cent of Australian universities offering a parking app. Its service fee is 6 per cent to EasyPark's 11.5 per cent, and it integrates directly with university authentication systems. Terms of the bargain App providers deserve payment as much as the next business. But parking apps strike deals that go beyond convenience, so we need to assess them fully and transparently. The NSW Department of Customer Service recently learned this when it was slammed by NSW’s Auditor-General for dealings with Duncan Solutions (developer of Park'nPay). The auditor cited no evidence of “value for money ” and a rushed procurement process. There are several key considerations. The first — parking apps generate honey pots of detailed information on people and their movements. This presents new privacy costs and risks, as experienced by EasyPark's European customers when home addresses, phone numbers, emails, scrambled passwords and partial financial information were stolen in a December 2023 hack . (The company claims no parking data was accessed in the breach.) Those wanting to offer parking apps must determine precisely what data the apps collect, where it goes and what is done with it. They should conduct thorough risk assessments on potential data misuse. Preferably apps should maintain customer and location information encrypted and on-device, reducing the risk of improper third-party access. Second, we need proper ""value for money"" assessments to address how parking apps cut into public revenue without significantly reducing costs (parking inspectors still patrol, and digital meters still need maintenance). Councils and campuses must publicly justify the trade-off — money paid to app providers reduces budgets for building public amenities or supporting core business. In sum, there should be complete, public assessment of the financial, privacy, access and inclusion implications of adopting parking apps. To prevent underhanded dealing, councils and campuses should also enable open competition between apps, as Mosman Council has done in Sydney. Streets tightly lined with parked cars is a common sight in many Australian suburbs. ( ABC News: Scott Jewell ) Parking is primal and paradoxical Beyond data privacy and revenue implications, there is a more fundamental matter. Parking apps have a vested interest in an abundance of parking, it's their core business. But one of the most significant economic and environmental revolutions underway in cities is a radical reassessment of what we've sacrificed in pursuit of parking. If we want long-term thinking about how to rescue and reimagine cities, we need to think beyond the apps. In the past two decades, urban planning scholars have revealed a number of stunning truths about drivers and cities. Landmark Australian research and books show that parking is primal and paradoxical. Every driver feels they deserve ""rockstar"" parking , ideally right at their destination, secure and free — and they're aggrieved if they can't have it. Behind the wheel, we assume a universal impatience, intolerance and entitlement. It simmers above the unspoken anxiety of not being able to park . Since the 1950s, cities have been defined by their valiant efforts to cater to these base instincts. We have paved them with car parks, relinquishing wetlands, parklands and foreshores. We have foregone housing and public amenities, all to ensure optimal storage of high-emissions private property. Superficially, better managing the supply of parking presents a perfect union with parking apps. Real-time management is just the kind of technocratic petri dish where apps love to breed. Yet scratch the surface and you'll find the apps are locking in the status quo. They further subordinate people and places to the primacy of parking. The great paradox is that while parking is both objectively abundant and an exorbitant tax on everyone, no driver is satisfied. So we build more parking, and download more apps, and our cities become less liveable.

Kezia Whitton's former religious community, the Jehovah's Witnesses, chose not to report her older brother Joel to police after learning he had abused her.  And they were not legally compelled to do so under West Australian law.  During the royal commission into child abuse, which spanned from 2013 to 2017, the faith group committed to reporting abuse to authorities.  Joel Whitton's formal confession to the church occurred after this.  But the institute chose to conduct its own investigation — and handed down its own restrictions to her abuser — according to a document seen by the ABC.  Kezia holds her candle. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  A Jehovah's Witness spokesperson previously told the ABC the group was unable to comment on the specifics of the case, but it regarded child abuse as a crime and an abhorrent sin.  If Ms Whitton was in another jurisdiction, her former church may have been legally required to report the abuse.  She said irregularities in the law across the country were creating a ""safe haven for monsters"" and that ""no-one is above the law"".  How do mandatory reporting laws work?  Each state and territory has its own laws on mandatory reporting.  Following the royal commission, some states chose to widen their laws to ensure religious ministers would have to tell authorities if an abuser confessed to wrongdoing.  This was because the royal commission exposed how many religious groups were dealing with abuse allegations using their own church processes while bypassing authorities.  Kezia Whitton wants uniform mandatory reporting laws around Australia. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  Queensland  In Queensland, if someone receives information that leads them to believe a sexual offence has been committed against a child, they must report it — ""even if the abuse happened a long time ago"".  If the information was received before July 2021, it does not have to be reported.  However, if the survivor is still under 18, other mandatory reporting laws apply.

Eight people living under one roof with a single toilet is less than ideal.  But amid a rental crisis, Cody considers herself lucky.  Scrolling real estate on her phone alongside her sister Holly, Cody is trying to find the light side.  ""It says 'uniquely designed',"" she laughs, pointing at what is on offer in their price range.  ""It says 'filled with character'!  ""That's when you know they're just trickin' ya.""  For Cody and many others, the hours of scrolling online for rentals are endless and disheartening. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  The 26-year-old retail worker has lost count of the number of applications they have put in, only to be knocked back.  ""We've lowered our expectations a lot. If it has a lock on the door and things are not falling apart completely then we will apply,"" she says.  ""It makes us feel depressed, like, what is the point?  ""In our generation now, it just seems so out of reach. It feels like we're just watching time tick by.  ""It's a real shame.""  'Heartbreaking' but it could be worse  Perth's vacancy rate has been sitting around 0.7 per cent for a year, which has sent rental prices soaring.  While wages grew 4.6 per cent in Western Australia last year, the median rent jumped by 20 per cent to its current price of $600.  Holly, Locky, Vicki, Nichole and Cody are just five of the eight people in the house. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  Cody is living with her 71-year-old grandmother, Vicki, along with her mum Nichole, her sister and teenage brother and both of their partners, plus a 17-year-old family friend who is couch surfing. There is one bathroom.  It's packed to the rafters, but Cody says she still feels fortunate.  ""There are people out there that are way worse off than us,"" she says.  ""I really empathise with all of Australia right now really struggling with a rental crisis.  ""The anxiety and depression surrounding this whole situation is really heartbreaking.""  'Sometimes I miss out on dinner'  Cody's mum Nichole, a single parent, is working three jobs to make ends meet.  Single mum Nichole has had to move back in with her mother amid the rental crisis. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  Sitting on her single bed, in a small room painted lime green, she starts by poking fun at her situation.  ""So, this is me, squashed in here, in the single bed,"" she says, laughing.  ""It's hard for [my] mum too, she's older and she just wants to retire and be on her own, but we're all stuck here.""  Contact 7.30 Do you know more about this story? Get in touch with Rhiannon Shine at shine.rhiannon@abc.net.au.  Nichole didn't expect to be living at her mum's place with her three adult kids at this stage in her life.  The 47-year-old is a disability support worker who has picked up some shifts at Bunnings for the extra cash.  ""It's a daily struggle,"" Nichole says.  ""Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially.""  Nichole is living here because she is waiting for her own home to be built, and could not afford to rent in the current market at the same time as paying her mortgage.  Vicki is 71 and has taken family members and their friends in due to the rental crisis. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  ""I shop the cheapest I can. It's hard because you're feeding eight people,"" she says.  ""It's not the best food, but it's food. You cook bulk meals.  ""Sometimes I just miss out on dinner. They eat it all and I'm like, 'That's cool, I'll have toast'.""  She brushes this last comment off with a laugh, but as it sinks in, her eyes fill with tears.  ""But that's OK,"" she says, wiping them away.  Compounding problems  Nichole started building her own home over two years ago with the help of a Morrison government home-building scheme for single parents, but given the chronic bottleneck in the construction sector, she is still waiting for it to be finished.  As highlighted in the latest report by private analytics company PropTrack, high build costs, limited labour availability and decade-high financing costs have all slowed dwelling commencements.  The same report, released on Tuesday, forecasts rents will continue to climb, particularly in the major capital cities, due to persistent low supply and strong demand, which is being exacerbated by population growth.  Perth's weekly median rent rise is higher than other capital cities.  ""Although population growth is forecast to slow, it will remain elevated this financial year and next,"" the report states.  ""These conditions highlight why it is so important to build more housing.""  Both the state and federal governments are investing more in social housing amid the dire shortage.  The WA government has recently opened up their Rent Relief Program that will allow tenants in private rentals to access a one-off support payment of up to $5,000 to cover rental arrears.  It has also moved to limit the number of times a landlord can increase rents to once a year.  But Maiy Azize from the national campaign Everybody's Home, aimed at highlighting Australia's rental crisis, says this will be cold comfort for tenants.  Cody has ben looking for somewhere else to live for eight months. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  ""We need real limits on rent increases, not just limits on when the rents can go up,"" she says.  WA Premier Roger Cook says capping rental increases could turn investors off, which would be to the detriment of housing supply.  ""There are a limited number of mechanisms in relation to caps on the rental market, and one of the things we don't want to do is drive investors out of the rental market,"" he told ABC Radio Perth on Tuesday morning.  ""Because investors coming in, getting a return on their investment actually boosts the amount of dwellings that are available to the rental market.""  Brazilian-born chef Ludley has experienced the full brunt of Perth's rental rollercoaster.  Ludley has had to limit excursions with his daughter. ( ABC News: Rhiannon Shine )  When he moved here in 2016, his rent was $400 a week.  It has been gradually increasing, and after a change of owner, his weekly rent in the same house will soon be upped to $685 a week.  ""It is heavy,"" he says.  ""We go from $400 to $685, that is almost 75 per cent.  ""My salary did not increase 75 per cent in this time span.""  He acknowledges that increased migration is partly to blame for the rising prices and wants more high-rises built, but in the interim says his daughter is also paying the price.  ""You have to start making decisions like, what are you not going to do?"" he says.  ""Can I go watch a movie with my daughter? No, I cannot, because I have to put this money on the rent.""  'Heart-wrenching' reality  Back at Cody's place, she is bracing for a looming Perth heatwave.  The room she is living in here at her Nanna's place is not insulated and has no cooling, because it was built years ago, not as a bedroom but as a sort-of games room, an extension to the house.  Because this room is the only way to get to the backyard, it doesn't provide much privacy.  Nichole has been climbing through her bedroom window to hang the washing out in the backyard because she wants to give her daughter privacy.  Nichole has been climbing out this window to give her daughter privacy. ( ABC: Rhiannon Shine )  ""I caught her [climbing out her bedroom window] a couple of weeks ago,"" Cody says.  ""She was like, 'I just didn't want to disturb you'. I felt so bad. I was like, 'don't be silly'.""  Nichole says she just wants her kids to be able to have a safe place to call home.  ""We're pretty ordinary, we don't expect an elaborate place. Just somewhere comfy.  ""It's heart-wrenching to see the kids try and get their place and they get knocked back all the time.  ""And they are like, 'what is the point of us even going to look at these houses', when you've got hundreds of people going and offering extra money, and they can't compete.""  Soon Nichole is packing her things to head out the door when she notices some unopened envelopes on the kitchen bench.  ""Rates, car, phone,"" she says, ""electricity just came in too.""  She sticks the notices on the fridge, alongside the other ones.  Then she's out the door and on the way to her third job.

9,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/apple-eu-app-store-changes-rules-europe-coming-to-australia-government-legislation,"Apple’s move to allow EU customers to download apps without using its app store paves the way for the Australian government to follow suit with its own legislation.  On Friday, Apple announced plans to overhaul the way apps work on iPhones and other iOS devices to allow more competition as part of a raft of changes designed to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act.  The company will also allow iPhone users to choose a different browser from the default, and to use alternative payment systems to Apple Pay.  Apple did not answer questions about why other territories, including Australia, had been left out of the change, but indicated on Friday they were not changes it would have made if not required to by EU law.  Apple and Google have faced pressure from developers and regulators across the globe in recent years over restrictions and fees of up to 30% per transaction in their respective app stores.  In November 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) handed down recommendations as part of its long-running digital platforms inquiry. It advised the government to establish a code of conduct to address anti-competitive behaviour on the platforms, such as self-preferencing, unfair business dealings and impediments to interoperability and the ability for consumers to switch services.  In December last year, the Albanese government said it supported the recommendations in-principle, saying the regulator had presented a strong case for the code, with some platforms having entrenched market power in particular services.  However, the government said the framework would be a “significant undertaking” and tasked treasury with developing a potential legislative framework that would require “extensive consultation”.  The assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, Stephen Jones, said the government was in the process of finalising a consultation paper “for a potential competition regime and will have more to say shortly”.  This equates for us to being the same or worse as under the old rules  In the December, the government said it was “closely monitoring international developments” and would ensure the developed framework was consistent and cohesive with overseas approaches.  Despite calls for changes to Apple’s model, the move has not been welcomed by some of its fiercest critics because developers who take advantage of the option will be charged a flat fee per app installation outside the app store.  Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, labelled the announcement “hot garbage” in a post on X last week. Epic is in litigation against Apple and Google in Australia in relation to their app stores.  Spotify – which does not allow its customers to subscribe through their iPhone app – said Apple’s announcement showed the company does not believe the rules apply to them, and aspects, such as an annual fee per download of apps, amounted to “extortion” of developers.  “Spotify, like so many other developers, now faces an untenable situation. Under the new terms, if we stay in the App Store and want to offer our own in-app payment, we will pay a 17% commission and a 0.50 cent Euro Core Technology Fee per install and year,” the company posted on its blog last week.  “This equates for us to being the same or worse as under the old rules.”  Mozilla – the developer of the Firefox browser – told the Verge the changes make it as “painful as possible” for developers to offer an alternative to the Safari web browser.  A spokesperson for Apple said it was supporting the success of developers.  “We’re happy to support the success of all developers – including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice – with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments,” the spokesperson said.  “Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.”  The company pointed out that because Spotify currently does not allow users to subscribe through the iPhone app it currently doesn’t pay Apple anything. Apple said the company could continue to pay nothing under the new EU system, but that Spotify’s comments suggested the streaming music company wanted to offer new services without paying Apple for the value provided.  Epic Games’ case against Apple and Google in Australia alleges misuse of market power over the app stores’ ban of Fortnite due to it offering its own payment options. The case will be heard in the federal court across three months beginning in March.

Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP Australia news Apple’s EU app store changes open door for Australia to improve digital platforms competition Australia is expected to look closely at Apple’s decision to comply with EU competition rules in light of its long-running digital platforms inquiry Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Josh Taylor @joshgnosis Tue 30 Jan 2024 00.44 GMT Last modified on Tue 30 Jan 2024 00.46 GMT Apple’s move to allow EU customers to download apps without using its app store paves the way for the Australian government to follow suit with its own legislation. On Friday, Apple announced plans to overhaul the way apps work on iPhones and other iOS devices to allow more competition as part of a raft of changes designed to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act . Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company will also allow iPhone users to choose a different browser from the default, and to use alternative payment systems to Apple Pay. Apple did not answer questions about why other territories, including Australia, had been left out of the change, but indicated on Friday they were not changes it would have made if not required to by EU law. Apple to allow EU customers to download apps without using App Store Read more Apple and Google have faced pressure from developers and regulators across the globe in recent years over restrictions and fees of up to 30% per transaction in their respective app stores. In November 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) handed down recommendations as part of its long-running digital platforms inquiry. It advised the government to establish a code of conduct to address anti-competitive behaviour on the platforms, such as self-preferencing, unfair business dealings and impediments to interoperability and the ability for consumers to switch services. In December last year, the Albanese government said it supported the recommendations in-principle, saying the regulator had presented a strong case for the code, with some platforms having entrenched market power in particular services. However, the government said the framework would be a “significant undertaking” and tasked treasury with developing a potential legislative framework that would require “extensive consultation”. The assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, Stephen Jones, said the government was in the process of finalising a consultation paper “for a potential competition regime and will have more to say shortly”. This equates for us to being the same or worse as under the old rules In the December, the government said it was “closely monitoring international developments” and would ensure the developed framework was consistent and cohesive with overseas approaches. Despite calls for changes to Apple’s model, the move has not been welcomed by some of its fiercest critics because developers who take advantage of the option will be charged a flat fee per app installation outside the app store. Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, labelled the announcement “hot garbage” in a post on X last week. Epic is in litigation against Apple and Google in Australia in relation to their app stores. Spotify – which does not allow its customers to subscribe through their iPhone app – said Apple’s announcement showed the company does not believe the rules apply to them, and aspects, such as an annual fee per download of apps, amounted to “extortion” of developers. Apple and Google face block on taking cut from in-app purchases in Australia Read more “Spotify, like so many other developers, now faces an untenable situation. Under the new terms, if we stay in the App Store and want to offer our own in-app payment, we will pay a 17% commission and a 0.50 cent Euro Core Technology Fee per install and year,” the company posted on its blog last week. “This equates for us to being the same or worse as under the old rules.” Mozilla – the developer of the Firefox browser – told the Verge the changes make it as “painful as possible” for developers to offer an alternative to the Safari web browser. A spokesperson for Apple said it was supporting the success of developers. “We’re happy to support the success of all developers – including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice – with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments,” the spokesperson said. “Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.” The company pointed out that because Spotify currently does not allow users to subscribe through the iPhone app it currently doesn’t pay Apple anything. Apple said the company could continue to pay nothing under the new EU system, but that Spotify’s comments suggested the streaming music company wanted to offer new services without paying Apple for the value provided. Epic Games’ case against Apple and Google in Australia alleges misuse of market power over the app stores’ ban of Fortnite due to it offering its own payment options. The case will be heard in the federal court across three months beginning in March. Epic won an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the United States late last year, but lost against Apple .

Kezia Whitton's former religious community, the Jehovah's Witnesses, chose not to report her older brother Joel to police after learning he had abused her.  And they were not legally compelled to do so under West Australian law.  During the royal commission into child abuse, which spanned from 2013 to 2017, the faith group committed to reporting abuse to authorities.  Joel Whitton's formal confession to the church occurred after this.  But the institute chose to conduct its own investigation — and handed down its own restrictions to her abuser — according to a document seen by the ABC.  Kezia holds her candle. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  A Jehovah's Witness spokesperson previously told the ABC the group was unable to comment on the specifics of the case, but it regarded child abuse as a crime and an abhorrent sin.  If Ms Whitton was in another jurisdiction, her former church may have been legally required to report the abuse.  She said irregularities in the law across the country were creating a ""safe haven for monsters"" and that ""no-one is above the law"".  How do mandatory reporting laws work?  Each state and territory has its own laws on mandatory reporting.  Following the royal commission, some states chose to widen their laws to ensure religious ministers would have to tell authorities if an abuser confessed to wrongdoing.  This was because the royal commission exposed how many religious groups were dealing with abuse allegations using their own church processes while bypassing authorities.  Kezia Whitton wants uniform mandatory reporting laws around Australia. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  Queensland  In Queensland, if someone receives information that leads them to believe a sexual offence has been committed against a child, they must report it — ""even if the abuse happened a long time ago"".  If the information was received before July 2021, it does not have to be reported.  However, if the survivor is still under 18, other mandatory reporting laws apply.  Northern Territory  In the NT, people ""must report"" their concerns if they believe a child ""is being or has been harmed or abused"".  Jehovah's Witnesses refer to their churches as Kingdom Halls. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  Minister for Territory Families Ngaree Ah Kit said the safety and wellbeing of children was an absolute priority.  Reporting requirements include historical and current allegations or concerns of abuse.  South Australia  An SA government spokesperson said people, including ministers of religion, had a legal obligation to notify the Department of Child Protection if they suspected a young person was at risk of harm.  The state's Criminal Code details how failing to report suspected child sexual abuse by ""prescribed persons including ministers of religion"" is also a criminal offence.  ""These circumstances include if the abuser previously engaged in sexual abuse of a child while an employee of an institution and the abuse occurred during the preceding 10 years,"" the spokesperson said.  The maximum penalty for failing to report suspected child abuse is three years in prison.  Western Australia  In Ms Whitton's home state of WA, religious ministers have had to report child abuse to authorities since 2022.  However, this does not include historical abuse.  Religious ministers are required to report historical abuse in some states. ( Foreign Correspondent: Tim Stevens )  Child Protection Minister Sabine Winton previously said the laws were intended to protect children now and not to address historical abuse.  Attorney-General John Quigley declined to comment on whether he thought the law should be reviewed in line with other states and territories.  Australian Capital Territory  The ACT Crimes Act states that a person commits an offence if they obtain information relating to the abuse of a child and do not give information to a police officer as soon as possible.  The offence is punishable by a maximum of two years' imprisonment.  Members of the clergy are not entitled to refuse to report information from a religious confession.  The ACT government spokesperson said the laws covered historical allegations.  A pamphlet from the Jehovah's Witnesses. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  Victoria  In Victoria, the Reportable Conduct Scheme states that some allegations of past or historical reportable conduct should be reported to authorities.  Religious organisations were included in the scheme from 2018.  According to a government report, an allegation made about a worker or volunteer employed by organisations included in the scheme, such as a religious organisation, may need to be reported and investigated, regardless of when it occurred.  This includes allegations that occurred before a particular group was included in the scheme.  Tasmania  The Tasmanian government said there were legislative provisions that required people, including clergy, to report any allegation or evidence of abuse.  They said there were also offences in the state's Criminal Code for failing to report abuse of a child.  However, the government said how this applied to historical matters was open to legislative interpretation.  Kezia punches a boxing bag outside her home. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore )  New South Wales  A New South Wales police spokesperson said they did not believe mandatory reporting included historical offences, but that a person could be charged for covering up a crime.  The NSW government was contacted for comment.  Hope for the future  Ms Whitton said ""child abuse is child abuse"" and which state it occurred in should not matter.  ""No-one is above the law,"" she said.  ""An important part of [the] rule of law is reviewing, updating, and removing laws to make sure they are 'fair and reflect social values'.

They said there were also offences in the state's Criminal Code for failing to report abuse of a child. However, the government said how this applied to historical matters was open to legislative interpretation. Kezia punches a boxing bag outside her home. ( ABC News: Briana Fiore ) New South Wales A New South Wales police spokesperson said they did not believe mandatory reporting included historical offences, but that a person could be charged for covering up a crime. The NSW government was contacted for comment. Hope for the future Ms Whitton said ""child abuse is child abuse"" and which state it occurred in should not matter. ""No-one is above the law,"" she said. ""An important part of [the] rule of law is reviewing, updating, and removing laws to make sure they are 'fair and reflect social values'. ""It's essential it's changed because what we have at the moment in WA with a loophole is not fair or reflecting social values.""

2,https://www.miragenews.com/boosting-support-for-australians-in-financial-1164223/,"Dept of Social Services  The Albanese Labor Government is committed to responding to cost of living and unexpected bills in Australian households and maintaining our capacity to respond to natural disasters by boosting support for the Financial Wellbeing and Capability grant programs.  The Government is today announcing an additional $114.8 million to strengthen support for Australians experiencing financial hardship.  The additional, ongoing funding, provided through Financial Wellbeing and Capability grant programs, will help address demand for critical frontline services over the next five years, and ensure certainty and stability for a number of organisations including those delivering emergency relief and financial counselling.  It will help more Australian households, including working families and people experiencing financial distress for the first-time, to pay and manage unexpected bills or expenses such as high electricity bills, rent, fuel and medicines.  It will also maintain our ability to provide targeted and responsive support in times of crisis and natural disasters.  The boost, which will be received by eligible organisations over the next month, reinstates funding cut under the previous Abbott Coalition Government in the 2014 Budget.  As part of the former government's Commission of Audit - established from October 2013 to June 2014 - savings of around $20 million per annum were taken from the Financial Wellbeing and Capability grant programs.  Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth said that cost of living pressures, bill shock and extreme weather events have created greater demand for financial wellbeing and capability services than ever before and boosting funding meant the sector would be able to provide more.  ""Our Government will always stand up for Australians doing it tough, unlike the Coalition. We acknowledge that some households in our community are doing it particularly tough due to natural disasters and bill shock,"" Minister Rishworth said.  ""We are seeing higher and more people with complex issues needing support, as many different kinds of Australian families and households grapple with the ongoing challenges of the last five years.  ""This is why we're providing a $114.8 million funding boost over the next five years, to assist frontline services to meet this demand, and to make it easier for those struggling to pay their bills, to access assistance and support.  The funding boost will provide existing financial wellbeing and capability services with the flexibility and security to respond to unexpected economic stressors including natural disasters impacting Australian families and communities.  Further improvements to Financial Wellbeing and Capability programs are being explored as part of a review undertaken by the Government this year, to ensure services continue to address the complex and changing needs of people and communities and deliver the best outcomes for people accessing services.","Boosting support for Australians in financial distress | Mirage News National World Canada New Zealand UK Local Australia Government Local Council Police News Business Technology Science Education Life Health Social Travel Sport University News Timeline Menu ☰ Latest Federal Government delaying state's development Discovery Rangers inspire park visitors Timber Efficiencies May Alleviate National Housing Crisis Residents urged to prepare for king tides next week 31 January 5 reasons you should donate blood Trusted Aussie Brand Revolutionizes Weight Loss in 2024 New Equipment Funding Boost For Ballarat Base Hospital Research Confirms Cumulative Brain-Wide Effects of ADHD Changes to Tusmore Wading Pool access Four-Day Work Week Predicted by 30% of Australians Mirage News Mirage News Mirage News Life 31 Jan 2024 8:54 am AEDT Date Time Share Boosting support for Australians in financial distress Dept of Social Services The Albanese Labor Government is committed to responding to cost of living and unexpected bills in Australian households and maintaining our capacity to respond to natural disasters by boosting support for the Financial Wellbeing and Capability grant programs.

The ADP® Research Institute's People at Work 2023: A Global Workforce View, found that three in ten Australian workers (30%) think that a four-day week will be the norm in their industry within the next five years.  This is not just wishful thinking on the part of employees - 11% of Australian workers say their employer already offers four-day work week arrangements as a means of promoting positive mental health at work, a trend that has increased by 8.6% since last year.  As traditional working patterns continue to undergo significant shifts, one in four Australian workers believe it will be the norm in their sector to have full flexibility over their hours within the next five years (provided they get their jobs done, based on productivity and results metrics). 24% foresee a hybrid working model becoming standard practice in that time.  Kylie Baullo, Managing Director ANZ at ADP, says: ""The four-day working week is no longer a distant dream – it's rapidly becoming a tangible reality in Australia.""  ""When traditional approaches like pay rises or offering remote work arrangements are not feasible, employers should explore innovative ways to ensure employee satisfaction, loyalty, motivation, and talent retention. They need to think outside the box.""  ""A four-day working week could be a favourable solution for both employers and employees. If a four-day working week aligns with business needs, enabling workers to achieve a better work-life balance without compromising productivity, this will result in a mutually beneficial outcome for all.""  ""Numerous businesses are already reaping the advantages of this change. The fact that an increasing number of companies are utilising a four-day week as a means to enhance mental health-wellbeing highlights the significant transformations in the workforce over the past few years.""  Recent research suggests that implementing a four-day working week can be a successful strategy.  Other flexible working options and entitlements are expected to change. 13% of Australian workers believe that in the next five years it will be the norm to purchase additional holiday allowance.

Other flexible working options and entitlements are expected to change. 13% of Australian workers believe that in the next five years it will be the norm to purchase additional holiday allowance. One in eight (12.5%) think that it will also become common practice to reduce their salary in return for more annual leave.

This development is being shared in the lead up to World Cancer Day (4 February) to serve as a reminder of All.Can Australia's commitment to partnering with key supporters, stakeholders and government to find real world solutions to improve health system efficiencies for cancer care.  Following the loss of her mother, Wendy Swan, to thyroid cancer metabolised to the lung, in June 2023, Dani Swan – who is a well-respected motion capture performer, actor, dancer, creative director and producer, pilates educator based in New York – wanted to honour her mother's wish for more efficient ways for Australians impacted by cancer to access treatment, information, support and care they require.  Wendy Swan was one of the longest patients to survive on a clinical trial medication and was a steadfast advocate for people with head and neck cancer. After receiving an initial 3-month prognosis in 2012, Wendy fought hard for 21 years with the strength and support of her family, a dedicated health team and the fact that she could access a clinical trial.  According to Dani Swan, the ambassadorship with All.Can Australia is a positive step forward to put the spotlight on real life experiences to ensure future health system changes address what matters most to people impacted by cancer.  ""My mum fought hard for herself, her family and for others affected by this insidious disease. As soon as I understood All.Can Australia's mission, I knew I wanted to support and share my mum's story to honour her legacy which is to help provide more resources like mental health and access to trial medication for all cancer patients and carers.""  ""I feel proud to have the opportunity to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with All.Can Australia and give back where I can as my mum did even during her 20+ years with cancer, she never stopped fighting for a change, especially for head and neck cancer,"" said Ms Swan.  Bill Petch, Co-Chair of All.Can Australia and Chief Executive Officer of Crohn's Colitis Cure, has known and worked with the Swan family for many years through other not-for-profit organisations.  ""Despite her own cancer fight, Wendy Swan gave as much time as she could to support others who were struggling with their own cancer diagnoses, even working with Head and Neck Cancer Social Club (HANCS) support group in Newcastle. Dani and her father Lyonel both share this selfless demeanour. Lyonel, taking care of Wendy without hesitation for over 20+years as well working hard to keep the family afloat like so many other carers in this world and Dani owing the drive in her life and career to her mums unwavering strength.""  ""We are excited to welcome Dani's support as All.Can Australia's first ambassador. The Swan family will help to give a voice to thousands of families who need greater and more accessible support,"" said Mr Petch.  In addition to announcing its first ambassador, All.Can Australia continues to play a pivotal role in the Australian Cancer Plan and has been formally included into the Cancer Nursing and Navigation Program's Navigation Working group.

Key points: In remote communities, freight costs and a lack of competition mean some products are more expensive than urban areas  In remote communities, freight costs and a lack of competition mean some products are more expensive than urban areas Foodbank says it has seen increased demand in the NT, WA, and Victoria  Foodbank says it has seen increased demand in the NT, WA, and Victoria A company that manages remote stores says balancing food security with a sustainable business is a challenge  Her current shop involves a two-hour round trip to Alice Springs and back to her home in Santa Teresa, also known as Ltyentye Apurte.  The main reason she does this is the sizeable price gap between the store serving her community and shops in Alice Springs.  ""[Alice Springs has] fresher foods and it's cheaper, much cheaper. In the community store, $200 or $300 doesn't get you much,"" she said.  The grocery trip is not just for herself, but her four children, her partner, and her mum.  ""When I shop in town I noticed a big difference. I can feed the kids and feed the family more and it lasts up until the next payday,"" she said.  She noticed she was not the only one making the trip from the Eastern Arrernte community.  ""A lot of people are doing that as well. But it's hard for others … the ones that haven't got cars,"" she said.  She once noticed a jar of Vegemite was double the price at her local store compared to Alice Springs.  Cost of living hurting regional Australia  Many Australians have been experiencing cost of living pressures, with grocery store giants now the focus of a federal government probe.

Key points: In remote communities, freight costs and a lack of competition mean some products are more expensive than urban areas Foodbank says it has seen increased demand in the NT, WA, and Victoria A company that manages remote stores says balancing food security with a sustainable business is a challenge Her current shop involves a two-hour round trip to Alice Springs and back to her home in Santa Teresa, also known as Ltyentye Apurte. The main reason she does this is the sizeable price gap between the store serving her community and shops in Alice Springs. ""[Alice Springs has] fresher foods and it's cheaper, much cheaper. In the community store, $200 or $300 doesn't get you much,"" she said. The grocery trip is not just for herself, but her four children, her partner, and her mum. ""When I shop in town I noticed a big difference. I can feed the kids and feed the family more and it lasts up until the next payday,"" she said. She noticed she was not the only one making the trip from the Eastern Arrernte community. ""A lot of people are doing that as well. But it's hard for others … the ones that haven't got cars,"" she said. She once noticed a jar of Vegemite was double the price at her local store compared to Alice Springs.

Further import bans on vapes will take effect from March 1.  The Australian Border Force (ABF) has seized more than 13 tonnes of disposable vapes in Adelaide in what the federal government says is the first large-scale bust since new laws took effect this year.  Authorities said nearly 250,000 vapes – with an estimated street value of $7.4 million – have been intercepted since January 1, when it became illegal to import disposable, single use vapes.  ABF Assistant Commissioner Chris Waters said during the past week, about 150,000 disposable vapes worth $4.5 million were seized in two shipments in South Australia.  Border force officers became suspicious when 14 air cargo consignments declared as ""refillable atomiser"" arrived from a single point of origin.  Mr Waters said the shipments came from China and arrived in Melbourne before being moved to South Australia.  ""Investigations are still continuing, but we don't think South Australia was the sole intended location for these vapes,"" Mr Waters said.  ""We've seen a significant decrease in the importation since [January 1] as industry has adapted to those changes.  ""It's difficult to know what the market is, but quarter of a million is a pretty good start for the first 30 days of [this] new legislation.""  Mr Waters said no charges had been laid yet, but investigations were continuing.  He said border officials had seen more passengers entering Australia surrender single use vapes at international airports after new rules limiting visitors to two single use vapes per person came in at the start of the year.  Federal Health Minister Mark Butler praised the efforts of ABF in one of the biggest seizures of vapes in Australia.  ""This is a quarter of a million disposable vapes that will not end up in the hands of our children,"" Mr Butler said.  ""Importantly, it's also choking off a market that is increasingly controlled by organised crime, by outlaw motorcycle gangs and other organised criminal gangs.""  Stricter vaping laws to come  Mr Butler said the tobacco industry had been marketing vapes towards children and young people ""with one objective in mind, that is to recruit a new generation to nicotine addiction"".  ""The tragedy of this is not only were we deceived, but that it's working,"" he said.  ""We heard stories over the last few months in exam seasons of high school students – Year 11, Year 12 – unable to get through a high school exam without nicotine patches.""  Mark Butler says stricter regulations on importing vapes will come into force from March 1. ( ABC News: Che Chorley )  The minister said he planned to introduce laws to stop the sale and supply of non-prescription vapes and close loopholes that allowed vape stores to open.  He said vapes being sold would need to comply to new standards such as being plain-flavoured, have prescribed nicotine-levels and have pharmaceutical packaging.  ""This is really designed to make sure to the extent there is a therapeutic pathway or therapeutic use for vapes, on prescription from your doctor or nurse practitioner or through your pharmacy,"" he said.  Further reforms will start from March 1, which includes a ban on importing refillable, non-therapeutic vapes as well as the personal importation of therapeutic vapes.  ""From 1st of March, it will only be possible to import vapes with a permit from the Office of Drug Protection and those vapes will need to comply with new standards that are put in place by the Therapeutic Goods Administration,"" Mr Butler said.","Almost 250,000 vapes seized in Adelaide following import ban on disposable vapes - ABC News This site uses cookies The ABC uses cookies to improve your experience.

Albanese spoke to ABC Radio Brisbane’s Kelly Higgins-Devine after a whirlwind tour of Queensland where he visited Townsville, Rockhampton and Brisbane in the course of one day.  “It was a reminder of the chaos and the dysfunction that continued throughout the period,” Albanese said.  “They just don’t like each other.”  But when Higgins-Devine reminded the prime minister that it wasn’t so long ago that Labor’s last stint in power was the subject of an ABC docuseries, The Killing Season, Albanese said they had learnt from the experience.  “The difference is that we are an orderly government now, which Australia deserves,” he said.  Loading  “We actually like each other. We don’t have the blatant undermining you saw in the Coalition years.”  Albanese was again pushed on the decision to change the stage 3 tax cuts he had promised to keep intact, claiming that “it’s not the easy decision, but it’s the right decision.”  Linking back to Nemesis, Albanese said he was “not obsessed by internals and what’s happening inside parliament house like what we saw last night.”  “I’m concerned with putting people before politics.”","australia news - Google Search Please click here if you are not redirected within a few seconds.

The material can be used in next-generation batteries and has been added to Australia's critical minerals list. What's next? A mining association says existing companies will be assessing their tenements, hoping to capitalise on demand for the niche critical mineral in the future.  An Australian company has announced plans to open the only commercial fluorite mine in the country, following the recent addition of the little-known resource to the national critical minerals list.

Titanium and vanadium miner Tivan advised shareholders of its intention to progress a fluorite project in Western Australia's Kimberley region in an announcement to the ASX.  Tivan chief executive Grant Wilson said the decision to progress the mine, located south-west of Kununurra, came following the federal government's addition of fluorite to Australia's critical minerals list in December.

""There is a strong supply-demand imbalance forecast to emerge, particularly from about 2025 in … acid-grade fluorspar, the material that's going into these next generation EV batteries,"" he said.  ""China... is deficient in reserves and if they continue to consume fluorspar at the rate that they are, they will run out in about 10 years, which is remarkable.""

""AMEC was expecting nickel and copper to be included to the critical minerals list, but they included fluoride and arsenic.  ""We then had a conversation with the minister's office and found it is critical in the sense that it is in desperately short supply and Australia doesn't have any fluorite mines at the moment.""  Mr Van Drunen said many mining companies were taking stock of their own deposits to see if they could make opportunistic decisions like Tivan.

Key points: The ship initially left Fremantle bound for Jordan on January 5  The ship initially left Fremantle bound for Jordan on January 5 The ship was ordered to return to Australia two weeks into its voyage  The ship was ordered to return to Australia two weeks into its voyage It's understood there are more than 15,000 animals on board  The animals have been at sea for 25 days on board the MV Bahijah after it was ordered by the government to turn back from its voyage to the Middle East due to security concerns in the strife-torn Red Sea.  The vessel arrived back off the WA coast yesterday and was expected to dock this morning but remains stationary about 10 kilometres off the port of Fremantle.  Animal advocates say the coming heatwave — with temperatures forecast to soar above 35 degrees over the next four days — will see conditions on board the ship deteriorate rapidly.  More than 15,000 sheep and cattle have been on board the ship for well over three weeks. ( ABC News )  But WA Premier Roger Cook told ABC Radio Perth on Tuesday he believed the welfare of the animals was still ""fairly high"".  ""But obviously they've been at sea now for quite a few days,"" he said.  ""There's a lot of them on that ship in fairly tight quarters.  ""We stand ready to help the Commonwealth resolve that issue.""  WAFarmers livestock division Geoff Pearson earlier flagged the preferred option was to restock the ship and send it back the long way — a 33-day voyage around the Horn of Africa that would avoid the Red Sea channel and potential violence by Houthi rebels targeting commercial vessels.  YouTube EXPLAINER: Who are the Houthi Rebels and why are they attacking ships in the Red Sea?  But Stop Live Exports coordinator Rebecca Tapp said the only humane option was to offload the animals and process them in Australia.  ""Certainly the idea of sending them back to sea for 33 days is inhumane,"" she said.  ""Live export is cruel, it can't be regulated, and it needs to end sooner rather than later.""  The premier said his government would work with the Commonwealth to help take some sheep off the vessel once it docks, which he hoped would happen on Wednesday.  ""My understanding is their initial aim is to at least get some off so that they can look after the welfare of those animals,"" Mr Cook said.  ""But we'll need to quarantine those animals because obviously they're coming from overseas so there are biosecurity measures in place to make sure they don't present with any diseases.""  The ship is mostly carrying sheep, but several thousand head of cattle are also on board. ( ABC News )  The ABC has been unable to contact the exporter — Israeli-based Bassem Dabbah — which operates through an Australian holding company.  The firm's Australian address is Prime Company Compliance, which helps offshore individuals register a business in Australia.  Prime Company Compliance declined to provide contact details for Bassem Dabbah's directors.  Concern about stench in Fremantle  City of Fremantle Mayor Hannah Fitzhardinge said she was concerned about the stench that would be emanating from the ship given the livestock had been on board for almost a month.  ""The real impact on the community … is the smell, the smell of sheep ships,"" she said.  Mayor of Fremantle Hannah Fitzhardinge does not support the live export trade. ( ABC News: Grace Burmas )  But Ms Fitzhardinge said while the stench was an obvious problem, in her opinion there was a bigger issue at stake — animal welfare.  ""It's going to smell pretty bad … but I think it's probably most importantly a reminder of why this trade is deeply inhumane,"" she said.  Well over 50,000 tonnes of sheep, cattle and calves were exported through the Fremantle Port last financial year.  Live export ban in spotlight  Federal MP for Fremantle Josh Wilson said the end of live exports ""can't come soon enough"".  ""We have a ship with thousands of sheep suffering intolerable heat and confinement as a result of the dangerous live sheep trade,"" he said.  ""It's a marginal trade, it's decreased by more than 90 per cent. It's worth less than one per cent of Western Australia's agricultural output.  ""It's well and truly time for us to bring this trade to an end.  ""That's why the Albanese government has made that commitment and is sensibly managing the end of the live sheep trade.""  Roger Cook says his government is working with the Commonwealth to find a solution. ( ABC News: Keane Bourke )  Asked on ABC Radio Perth if he supported the live export ban, Premier Cook said there needed to be a solution that considers the interests of farmers.  ""We have actually been supporting the farmers in relation to live animal exports, we made a submission to the Commonwealth ... it will have about $129 million impact on our industry, the loss of around 400 jobs,"" he said.  ""Ideally, I'd love to see meat processed in Western Australia, that means more Western Australian jobs, it means better care for those animals.  ""But the fact of the matter is, is that a lot of our farmers rely upon an ecosystem, which involves live animal exports.  ""So if the Commonwealth wants to move away from that, they have to be able to provide a solution to the farmers about how that will impact on their industry.""  Want more local WA news?

6,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/reality-tv-dominating-australian-screens/103404904,"Channel Nine's Married at First Sight (MAFS) has once again dominated Australia's TV ratings with a reach of 2,461,000 viewers for the season 11 debut.  The show beat out Network 10 and Channel Seven's heavy hitters Survivor Australia and Australian Idol, and the ABC's political documentary Nemesis.  MAFS follows pairs of strangers who first meet at their ""wedding"" before living together for several weeks. Each season is full of drama, including affairs between couples, leaking OnlyFans images and participants throwing drinks at each other.  For the number of people who are watching, there are often just as many calling for it to be cancelled.  Although MAFS topped the overnight ratings, the fact that season 9 of Idol reached 1.7 million viewers and season 9 of Survivor reached 1.1 million, shows that there is a strong appetite for reality TV in Australia.  Editor and co-creator of TV Blackbox Steve Molk said this is because of the way reality TV allows viewers to ""take a sneak peek into other people's lives"".  A Nine spokesperson said MAFS engaged Australians year on year ""and continues to become a part of the cultural conversation that captures the Zeitgeist"".  Whatever the reason viewers tune in for, MAFS will certainly be bringing joy to Channel Nine's bottom line.  ""This is its 11th season, so by now they are deep in relationship with advertisers,"" Mr Molk said.  ""They know how to integrate products into the show relatively seamlessly. It's a known entity in the advertising market.  ""So if you've got a product that you want to get in front of the most viewers at this time of year, that's the show that you want to target.""  Married at First Sight has been on air for 11 seasons. ( Supplied: Nine )  The rate of return is likely massive for Nine. Compared to scripted drama, there can be real cost savings in reality TV.  ""It costs a lot of money to make these [reality] programmes,"" Mr Molk said.  ""In the case of MAFS, where they've got 10 couples, there's a cameraman and sound guy and a producer with them for the best part of 18 hours a day.  ""And then there's an army of editors, producers, executives and a whole bunch of people in the background ... all of which exist in the scripted drama environment.  ""The key thing that is missing is script writers, and we still need a cast and we pay actors more than we're going to pay reality participants.""  He said reality TV also had the added bonus of being able to easily integrate sponsored content into the show to increase their bottom line.  Survivor Australia first aired in 2002. ( Supplied: Network 10 )  Reality meeting quotas  Commercial networks are required under the Broadcasting Act to provide 55 per cent overall Australian content on their primary channels between 6am and midnight. Reality TV is just one way they fill that quota.  Coming this year, streaming services which tend to have a larger portion of scripted drama shows, will also have to fulfil local content quotas.  Mr Molk said the benefit paid streaming services have over free-to-air was the amount of data they have available about viewers, making it easier for them to commission drama more specifically.  And while streaming on-demand services continue to be popular, the 7:30pm time slot remains vital for free-to-air networks.  ""Reality at 7:30 has become not only a standard but a necessary standard for the commercial networks.  ""They know if they get the right formula or the big new thing, they'll get a big audience guaranteed.""  But as is with any show, there comes a point where audiences start to wane.  ""The magic of television programming is working out when to cancel it or to move it on before it fades,"" Mr Molk said.  ""And every year for the past three years I would have said, 'This is it, they can't do anymore, get any more outrageous, get any bigger than this with Married at First Sight'.  ""And yet, every year the casting just continues to surprise us and deliver a massive series.""  Kyle Sandilands, Marcia Hines and Amy Shark are the judges for the 2024 season of Australian Idol. ( X: Australian Idol )  Mr Molk said Channel Seven's revamp of Australian Idol was likely giving the network diminishing returns year on year and was an example of a show that would be at a crossroads of rejuvenating or dropping.  ""We saw that with MasterChef particularly, it was huge for about five or six seasons then it started to fade.  ""They made some changes, some didn't work, some did... it's done OK, but it's never really hit those heights again.""  Early seasons of MasterChef Australia were massively popular. ( Masterchef Australia: Channel 10 )  However, Mr Molk said he expected MAFS will be around for many seasons to come.  ""While there are people that are willing to debase themselves in an attempt to become famous, Married at First Sight will always have an audience,"" he said.  ""It will always top the ratings now until it goes beyond the pale, until someone does something that causes enough, broad outrage that the show gets 'cancelled' I think it'll be hard to stop.""","Married at First Sight dominates TV ratings again, showing Australia's continued appetite for reality TV - ABC News This site uses cookies The ABC uses cookies to improve your experience.

""And every year for the past three years I would have said, 'This is it, they can't do anymore, get any more outrageous, get any bigger than this with Married at First Sight'. ""And yet, every year the casting just continues to surprise us and deliver a massive series."" Kyle Sandilands, Marcia Hines and Amy Shark are the judges for the 2024 season of Australian Idol. ( X: Australian Idol ) Mr Molk said Channel Seven's revamp of Australian Idol was likely giving the network diminishing returns year on year and was an example of a show that would be at a crossroads of rejuvenating or dropping. ""We saw that with MasterChef particularly, it was huge for about five or six seasons then it started to fade. ""They made some changes, some didn't work, some did... it's done OK, but it's never really hit those heights again."" Early seasons of MasterChef Australia were massively popular. ( Masterchef Australia: Channel 10 ) However, Mr Molk said he expected MAFS will be around for many seasons to come. ""While there are people that are willing to debase themselves in an attempt to become famous, Married at First Sight will always have an audience,"" he said. ""It will always top the ratings now until it goes beyond the pale, until someone does something that causes enough, broad outrage that the show gets 'cancelled' I think it'll be hard to stop.""

7,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/godfreys-vacuum-cleaner-retailer-collapse-voluntary-administration,"The vacuum cleaner retailer Godfreys Group has collapsed, leaving administrators in search of a buyer to keep the 93-year-old brand alive as they prepare to close dozens of stores, resulting in almost 200 jobs being lost.  The specialist retailer was ultimately felled by a recent and sharp pullback in consumer spending, although it had long been suffering from a generational change in how people buy vacuum cleaners.  Administrators PwC will now try to sell the business and assets. The firm said it expects to close 54 stores within two weeks in Australia and New Zealand, resulting in 193 job losses.  The fate of the broader business, which includes 141 stores employing more than 600 staff as well as a number of franchisee-owned stores, will depend on the success of the sales process, and how a new owner might want to run the company.  Jane Allen, the daughter of Godfreys co-founder John Johnston, said the appointment of administrators was sad but necessary.  “While it’s deeply regrettable, we need to take this action. This decision has been made in the best interests of our employees, together with our customers – it’s about securing the company’s future,” said Allen.  “Despite our best efforts to improve profitability through various platforms, unfortunately, Godfreys has been hit by conditions beyond our control, including the weakness in discretionary spending by consumers, which has had an ongoing and significant impact on sales.”  Established in 1931, Godfreys grew into one of the world’s biggest specialist vacuum retailers before going through a tumultuous period marked by a string of different owners.  It was listed on the stock exchange as recently as 2018, before being bought back by Johnston, who was frustrated with the company’s performance.  The 100-year-old died just a few months after his purchase.  PwC will restructure the business and run the sales process.  “Our aim is to move quickly to restructure Godfreys to preserve as much of the business and as many jobs as possible,” said Craig Crosbie, a PwC partner.  PwC cited lower customer demand amid cost-of-living pressures, higher operating costs, and increased competition for the financial stress.  Retail expert Brian Walker said that while society changed, Godfreys struggled to innovate.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

2,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/nemesis-abc-documentary-coalition-tony-abbott-scott-morrison-malcolm-turnbull,"Tony Abbott considered military action in response to MH17, took criticism of the gender split of his cabinet ‘very badly’, and repeatedly told Malcolm Turnbull to ‘fuck off’ after Turnbull defeated him in a partyroom coup.  Such were the gems learned in the ABC’s much-anticipated documentary series on the Coalition’s recent decade in power, Nemesis, which premiered on Monday night.  Cataloguing the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years between 2013 and 2022, the three-part programme features reflections from key players in that period, including George Brandis, Barnaby Joyce and Josh Frydenberg.  Here’s what we learned in part one.  Abbott considered military response to MH17  Abbott did not participate in the ABC series, but Turnbull and Morrison did. An editor’s note at the beginning of the episode claimed Abbott “declined to participate” and was the only prime minister not to be interviewed in such a series in the 30 years they had been broadcast by the ABC.  One major revelation of the episode, reported by the ABC before the broadcast, was a claim from former army chief Sir Angus Houston – then the special envoy to Ukraine – that Abbott had considered a deployment of Australian troops to the site of the MH17 plane disaster. The passenger plane was shot down near Ukraine’s border by Russian-backed separatists on 17 July 2014, with 27 Australians among the 298 casualties.  “I got a phone call four o’clock one morning. And it seemed to me it was going to be quite a large military deployment,” Houston said.  “I was concerned that the military option would be provocative, because the crash site was only a short distance from the Russian border, and already I was aware of a huge buildup of Russian forces on the border.”  Houston said he and Abbott had “a very sensible discussion about all the factors at play”, which Houston said ended with Abbott telling him: “OK, Angus, I accept your advice. It’ll be a police-led option.”  Warren Truss, Abbott’s deputy prime minister, said: “Tony Abbott really activated a war cabinet-style of approach to the incident. So Australia certainly prepared for this whole incident to escalate, that we may need to send troops.”  Turnbull described Abbott’s response to the MH17 incident – which included his threat to “shirtfront” Russian president Vladimir Putin – as “strong”, as well “childish” and “pugnacious”.  Former Liberal senator Eric Abetz, a supporter of Abbott, said: “International bullies need to be shirtfronted immediately because they become emboldened by each extra activity.”  Turnbull labels Abbott ‘dangerous’  Turnbull was scathing of Abbott’s demeanour, especially in regard to national security.  “He was talked out of it by our military leadership. Basically this was a thought bubble that was quickly punctured. But it showed, if you like, the elements of Tony that started to make me feel that we had a very dangerous prime minister,” Turnbull said.  “And nowhere more so, than in the way Tony Abbott was talking about terrorism.”  Turnbull went on to criticise Abbott’s trend of placing large numbers of Australian flags at his press conferences when discussing national security incidents, such as the Lindt cafe siege. He claimed Abbott was “was amping up the rhetoric in a way that was calculated to frighten people”.  Then attorney general George Brandis, giving his analysis, said: “Every decision that Tony Abbott made in relation to national security was informed by the advice of the national security agencies.”  “Now, I understand people might quibble about some of the rhetoric that Tony used, but in terms of decision making, the decisions were always professionally informed.”  Abbott took gender criticism ‘badly’  An early criticism of Abbott’s government was his decision to only name one woman – Julie Bishop – in his first cabinet of 20 ministers. Much media attention was devoted to this gender disparity.  Then education minister Christopher Pyne said the “inner sanctum” of the cabinet gathered for dinner in Canberra soon after the election.  “Somebody did raise the issue about only one woman, Julie Bishop, being in the cabinet. And Tony Abbott as the new prime minister, he took very badly to being given that advice,” Pyne claimed.  Liberal senator Linda Reynolds commented: “I think it said to all of us that women weren’t really valued enough to be selected into the ministry, and in particular into cabinet.”  “It certainly didn’t send the right message.”  The documentary aired file footage of Abbott saying at a press conference: “Plainly I am disappointed that there are not at least two women in the cabinet. Nevertheless, there are some very good and talented women knocking on the door of the cabinet.”  Reynolds claimed the situation was “was a very masculine environment”.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Karen Andrews claimed that, at the time, “the level of alcohol in [Parliament House] was beyond anything that I had ever seen”.  “A lot of it was the males that would get together in each other’s offices. Now, that meant that a lot of things were discussed, talked about, strategised, without the women even being part of those discussions,” Andrews said.  Then minister Simon Birmingham claimed the absence of women in Abbott’s cabinet was “a symptom of problems that were to come to dog us more fundamentally in an electoral sense in years to come, and to this very day”.  Morrison thought Prince Philip knighthood was ‘fake news’  One lighter moment among the serious political machinations of the episode was the discussion among Coalition MPs of Abbott’s 2014 “captain’s call” decision to confer a knighthood on Prince Philip – the husband of Queen Elizabeth, then Australia’s monarch.  “I’m really pleased that the Queen has seen fit to award knighthoods in the Order of Australia to Prince Philip,” Abbott said at the time, viewers were reminded.  Former education minister Christopher Pyne said that “to my horror” the first he’d heard of the decision was through a radio news bulletin on the morning of Australia Day.  “And I won’t say what I said because it’s on television, but I thought, ‘this is going to be a really bad day’,” Pyne said.  Reminded of the episode, Joyce simply said: “Prince Philip. Oh god. That was a shocker.”  Abbott’s successors in office were even more blunt. Morrison, recounting his reaction at the time, said: “I thought it was fake news. I thought it was a gag.”  Compounding earlier criticisms of Abbott, Turnbull said the then PM was “at least on this occasion, quite crackers”.  Abbott didn’t appear in the series so didn’t get a chance to respond on-camera to those remarks.  Turnbull says Abbott ‘told me to fuck off’  Turnbull claimed Abbott “didn’t welcome my inquiries” when he reached out following the 2015 leadership coup.  “He generally told me to fuck off. He had quite a few variations on that,” Turnbull claimed.  Asked about the aftermath of the leadership spill that saw Abbott deposed and Turnbull promoted to the prime minister’s office, Turnbull said: “I did reach out to Abbott to see how he was going. He didn’t welcome my inquiries.”  While later episodes of Nemesis will take in the end of Turnbull’s leadership and the start of Morrison’s, the most recent former PM does make quite an appearance in the first episode.  At one stage, the conversation turns to the robodebt scheme, which was championed by Morrison as social services minister and then treasurer.  Asked what he would say to people affected by the robodebt scandal, Morrison gave a similar answer to his responses after the royal commission report was released: “Policy decisions you make from time to time won’t go as you had intended them to. [We didn’t want to] cause harm to anyone.  “If we had been advised by the department that they had legal advice which said this was not lawful, it would never have been taken forward.”","Power, politics and the f-word: ABC series reveals inner workings of Coalition’s decade in power | Australian politics | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Australia World AU politics Environment Climate crisis Indigenous Australia Immigration Media Business Science Tech Podcasts Newsletters More Malcolm Turnbull, Julie Bishop, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison in parliament in March 2015, when  Abbott was still Australian prime minister.

Former education minister Christopher Pyne said that “to my horror” the first he’d heard of the decision was through a radio news bulletin on the morning of Australia Day. “And I won’t say what I said because it’s on television, but I thought, ‘this is going to be a really bad day’,” Pyne said. Reminded of the episode, Joyce simply said: “Prince Philip. Oh god. That was a shocker.” Abbott’s successors in office were even more blunt. Morrison, recounting his reaction at the time, said: “I thought it was fake news. I thought it was a gag.” Compounding earlier criticisms of Abbott, Turnbull said the then PM was “at least on this occasion, quite crackers”. Abbott didn’t appear in the series so didn’t get a chance to respond on-camera to those remarks. Turnbull says Abbott ‘told me to fuck off’ Turnbull claimed Abbott “didn’t welcome my inquiries” when he reached out following the 2015 leadership coup . “He generally told me to fuck off. He had quite a few variations on that,” Turnbull claimed. Asked about the aftermath of the leadership spill that saw Abbott deposed and Turnbull promoted to the prime minister’s office, Turnbull said: “I did reach out to Abbott to see how he was going. He didn’t welcome my inquiries.” Morrison comments on robodebt While later episodes of Nemesis will take in the end of Turnbull’s leadership and the start of Morrison’s, the most recent former PM does make quite an appearance in the first episode. Former PMs pour cold water on claims Anthony Pratt told them Trump’s US submarine secrets Read more At one stage, the conversation turns to the robodebt scheme, which was championed by Morrison as social services minister and then treasurer. Asked what he would say to people affected by the robodebt scandal , Morrison gave a similar answer to his responses after the royal commission report was released: “Policy decisions you make from time to time won’t go as you had intended them to. [We didn’t want to] cause harm to anyone. “If we had been advised by the department that they had legal advice which said this was not lawful, it would never have been taken forward.” Explore more on these topics Australian politics Australian Broadcasting Corporation Tony Abbott Scott Morrison Malcolm Turnbull Liberal party features Reuse this content Comments (…) Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion Most viewed Most viewed Australia World AU politics Environment Climate crisis Indigenous Australia Immigration Media Business Science Tech Podcasts Newsletters News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

8,https://www.miragenews.com/australian-govts-urged-to-fully-fund-public-1164255/,"The Australian Education Union today called on all governments to commit to ending the underfunding of public schools as a matter of urgency saying the future of the teaching profession is at stake along with the quality of education delivered across the nation.  AEU Federal President Correna Haythorpe welcomed news today that WA is going to be the first state to commit to fully funding public schools by 2026.  But Ms Haythorpe said there needed to be a bigger investment than the one proposed by the Commonwealth and the WA Government to achieve that goal.  ""Right now, only 1.3% of public schools are funded to the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) which is the minimum level governments agreed over a decade ago was required to meet the needs of their students,"" Ms Haythorpe said.  ""We applaud the commitment by the Federal Education Minister Jason Clare and the WA Government to get schools to 100% of the SRS by 2026. However, today's agreement will only see WA public schools reach 96% of the SRS.  ""WA's SRS funding share is artificially inflated by 4% through the inclusion of costs not directly related to the education of students in schools, such as capital depreciation, transport and regulatory costs. That 4% of the SRS was worth $230 million for WA in 2023 and that money still needs to be delivered to WA public schools before schools are truly funded at 100% of the SRS.  ""This has to be the first step rather than the final agreement.  ""With full funding principals and teachers can change the lives of students across the nation. It will mean more help for children at risk of falling behind and more support for teachers inside and outside of the classroom to cut their workloads and help address the growing needs of students.  ""Short-changing our schools is short-changing our students at a time when we can least afford it. The challenges are too great and the human costs too high not to fully resource our schools.  ""We have a teacher shortage crisis caused by crippling workloads, unacceptable achievement gaps between children from different backgrounds and locations and a worrying decline in student mental health and wellbeing.""  Ms Haythorpe said all public schools across the nation should reach a genuine 100% of the SRS by 2028 with the Albanese Government lifting its share from 20% of the SRS to 25% of the SRS for states and 40% of the SRS in the NT.  There also needs to be a significant investment of capital funding in new bilateral agreements struck this year.  ""The Commonwealth has underfunded public schools for decades while overfunding private schools. Only 1.6% of the federal budget is spent on public schools,"" she said.  ""The Albanese Government's current offer of 22.5% of the SRS should be revised to 25% of the SRS for all states and 40% of the SRS for the NT by 2028.""  Parliamentary Budget Office figures show that an average annual investment of just over $1.8 billion is required if the Commonwealth is to lift its funding share from 20% of the SRS this year to 25% by 2028.  Ms Haythorpe said an Expert Panel convened by education ministers in December warned the need for full funding in every state and territory was ""urgent and critical"" and the first step towards ensuring all students receive the support they need.  The panel said full funding must be delivered across the country ""within a comparable timeline"".  ""As the Expert Panel found, funding gaps are fuelling unacceptable achievement gaps between students from different backgrounds and locations,"" Ms Haythorpe said.  ""Disadvantaged secondary students are six times more likely to be low performers than those from advantaged backgrounds.

AEU Federal President Correna Haythorpe welcomed news today that WA is going to be the first state to commit to fully funding public schools by 2026. But Ms Haythorpe said there needed to be a bigger investment than the one proposed by the Commonwealth and the WA Government to achieve that goal. ""Right now, only 1.3% of public schools are funded to the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) which is the minimum level governments agreed over a decade ago was required to meet the needs of their students,"" Ms Haythorpe said. ""We applaud the commitment by the Federal Education Minister Jason Clare and the WA Government to get schools to 100% of the SRS by 2026. However, today's agreement will only see WA public schools reach 96% of the SRS. ""WA's SRS funding share is artificially inflated by 4% through the inclusion of costs not directly related to the education of students in schools, such as capital depreciation, transport and regulatory costs. That 4% of the SRS was worth $230 million for WA in 2023 and that money still needs to be delivered to WA public schools before schools are truly funded at 100% of the SRS. ""This has to be the first step rather than the final agreement. ""With full funding principals and teachers can change the lives of students across the nation. It will mean more help for children at risk of falling behind and more support for teachers inside and outside of the classroom to cut their workloads and help address the growing needs of students. ""Short-changing our schools is short-changing our students at a time when we can least afford it. The challenges are too great and the human costs too high not to fully resource our schools. ""We have a teacher shortage crisis caused by crippling workloads, unacceptable achievement gaps between children from different backgrounds and locations and a worrying decline in student mental health and wellbeing."" Ms Haythorpe said all public schools across the nation should reach a genuine 100% of the SRS by 2028 with the Albanese Government lifting its share from 20% of the SRS to 25% of the SRS for states and 40% of the SRS in the NT. There also needs to be a significant investment of capital funding in new bilateral agreements struck this year. ""The Commonwealth has underfunded public schools for decades while overfunding private schools. Only 1.6% of the federal budget is spent on public schools,"" she said. ""The Albanese Government's current offer of 22.5% of the SRS should be revised to 25% of the SRS for all states and 40% of the SRS for the NT by 2028."" Parliamentary Budget Office figures show that an average annual investment of just over $1.8 billion is required if the Commonwealth is to lift its funding share from 20% of the SRS this year to 25% by 2028. Ms Haythorpe said an Expert Panel convened by education ministers in December warned the need for full funding in every state and territory was ""urgent and critical"" and the first step towards ensuring all students receive the support they need. The panel said full funding must be delivered across the country ""within a comparable timeline"". ""As the Expert Panel found, funding gaps are fuelling unacceptable achievement gaps between students from different backgrounds and locations,"" Ms Haythorpe said. ""Disadvantaged secondary students are six times more likely to be low performers than those from advantaged backgrounds. ""Declining student mental health and wellbeing is a major source of concern and there are acute teacher shortages across the country caused by unsustainable workloads. ""We don't have a level playing field in education that ensures every child gets every opportunity to succeed. Fixing that starts with funding."" /Public Release.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/john-howard-documents-iraq-war-missing-inquiry-covid-pandemic-2003-cabinet-records,"A “forgotten” box of cabinet records and a series of administrative errors are among the reasons why a tranche of Howard-era documents was mistakenly kept from public release earlier this year.  An independent review into why 82 cabinet records from 2003 were not handed to the national archives, released on Tuesday, found there was no political interference or influence at play.  Instead, the Covid-19 pandemic had become a “catalyst for a major breakdown” in the transfer of the Howard government records, including 14 which related – at least in part – to the government’s decision to join the Iraq war.  On the first day of each year, cabinet documents from 20 years prior are released to the public. Those documents are transferred from the prime minister and cabinet’s department (PM&C) to the national archives years earlier to be prepared for public release.  The former defence department secretary, Dennis Richardson, was appointed to lead a review after PM&C confirmed on New Year’s Day it had found 78 documents were mistakenly not transferred in 2020 due to “apparent administrative oversights”.  Another four documents were located on 4 January 2024 after department staff conducted another physical inspection.  Richardson’s found those oversights, exposed further by the pandemic, included an inconsistent understanding among staff of their archival obligations and a lack of staff with record-management experience.  “The particular pandemic-driven work environment of 2020 became the catalyst for a major breakdown which, given the compounding systemic issues, was probably inevitable at some point,” the report said.  Richardson’s review found pandemic restrictions in 2020 meant staff could not physically inspect the boxes of cabinet records to ensure no non-cabinet intelligence documents were accidentally included.  As a result, a box of cabinet documents was left in a “secure storage area” within the department pending an intelligence agency review. The review found it was then “subsequently forgotten”.  PM&C also told the review it held cabinet records in different locations due to their security classifications but had no central register.  During the course of the review, the department’s cabinet division revealed it had found 30 cabinet notebooks ranging from 1978 to 1992 that hadn’t been sent to the national archives.  Adding to the complexity, only staff with a top security clearance could access records in certain rooms.  In one case, once staff did gain access to a special security room, they were confronted with “several cabinets” no one in the cabinet division team had access to. Eventually, four cabinet records were located in a sealed envelope within the room.  “The material within the room holding cabinet records was poorly itemised, tailor-made for a mistake in a future transfer process from PM&C to the NAA,” the report said.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Richardson said the national archives had now received the extra 82 records. The archives will now review the documents for exempted material and consult intelligence agencies before a decision is made on their release.  National security committee (NSC) documents related to the Iraq war were largely missing from the huge volume of material released by the archives on New Year’s Day.  NSC records that do not go to cabinet are not automatically released but can be applied for release with a decision made by the information commissioner on a case-by-case basis.  One document included in the 1 January release showed the full cabinet signed off on the decision to send Australia to war on 18 March 2003 based on “oral reports by the prime minister”.  The document did not contain mention of any doubt about Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction – the key justification for war – which proved to be false.  Of the original 77 missing cabinet records that were discovered, Richardson said 13 records, containing 38 NSC minutes, related to the war.  Upon announcing Richardson’s review into the archiving error, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this month it was crucial Australians were told why Howard joined Australia in the US’s invasion.","Howard-era files on Iraq war went missing due to ‘major breakdown’, inquiry finds | Australian politics | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian Support the Guardian Fund independent journalism with $5 per month Support us Support us News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Australia World AU politics Environment Climate crisis Indigenous Australia Immigration Media Business Science Tech Podcasts Newsletters More John Howard with Australian soldiers in Baghdad in July 2005.

Photograph: Reuters Australian politics Howard-era files on Iraq war went missing due to ‘major breakdown’, inquiry finds Inability of staff to inspect cabinet records means they were were not released to the national archives, as was usual Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast Sarah Basford Canales Tue 30 Jan 2024 07.01 GMT A “forgotten” box of cabinet records and a series of administrative errors are among the reasons why a tranche of Howard-era documents was mistakenly kept from public release earlier this year. An independent review into why 82 cabinet records from 2003 were not handed to the national archives, released on Tuesday, found there was no political interference or influence at play. Instead, the Covid-19 pandemic had become a “catalyst for a major breakdown” in the transfer of the Howard government records, including 14 which related – at least in part – to the government’s decision to join the Iraq war. On the first day of each year, cabinet documents from 20 years prior are released to the public. Those documents are transferred from the prime minister and cabinet’s department (PM&C) to the national archives years earlier to be prepared for public release. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The former defence department secretary, Dennis Richardson, was appointed to lead a review after PM&C confirmed on New Year’s Day it had found 78 documents were mistakenly not transferred in 2020 due to “apparent administrative oversights”. Morrison government failed to give Howard-era national security cabinet papers to national archives Read more Another four documents were located on 4 January 2024 after department staff conducted another physical inspection. Richardson’s found those oversights, exposed further by the pandemic, included an inconsistent understanding among staff of their archival obligations and a lack of staff with record-management experience. “The particular pandemic-driven work environment of 2020 became the catalyst for a major breakdown which, given the compounding systemic issues, was probably inevitable at some point,” the report said. Richardson’s review found pandemic restrictions in 2020 meant staff could not physically inspect the boxes of cabinet records to ensure no non-cabinet intelligence documents were accidentally included. As a result, a box of cabinet documents was left in a “secure storage area” within the department pending an intelligence agency review. The review found it was then “subsequently forgotten”. PM&C also told the review it held cabinet records in different locations due to their security classifications but had no central register. During the course of the review, the department’s cabinet division revealed it had found 30 cabinet notebooks ranging from 1978 to 1992 that hadn’t been sent to the national archives. Adding to the complexity, only staff with a top security clearance could access records in certain rooms. In one case, once staff did gain access to a special security room, they were confronted with “several cabinets” no one in the cabinet division team had access to. Eventually, four cabinet records were located in a sealed envelope within the room. “The material within the room holding cabinet records was poorly itemised, tailor-made for a mistake in a future transfer process from PM&C to the NAA,” the report said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Richardson said the national archives had now received the extra 82 records. The archives will now review the documents for exempted material and consult intelligence agencies before a decision is made on their release. National security committee (NSC) documents related to the Iraq war were largely missing from the huge volume of material released by the archives on New Year’s Day. NSC records that do not go to cabinet are not automatically released but can be applied for release with a decision made by the information commissioner on a case-by-case basis. One document included in the 1 January release showed the full cabinet signed off on the decision to send Australia to war on 18 March 2003 based on “oral reports by the prime minister” . The document did not contain mention of any doubt about Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction – the key justification for war – which proved to be false. Of the original 77 missing cabinet records that were discovered, Richardson said 13 records, containing 38 NSC minutes, related to the war. Greens demand full release of government documents on ‘disastrous’ decision to join Iraq invasion Read more Upon announcing Richardson’s review into the archiving error, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this month it was crucial Australians were told why Howard joined Australia in the US’s invasion.

This time around, it had managed to avoid serious devastation.  Less than 12 months earlier, however, the same building wasn't so fortunate.  The floors were left caked in hardened mud, with schoolbooks and classroom resources badly damaged and destroyed.  Floodwaters damaged property at the Pigeon Hole school in March 2023. ( Supplied )  For Ms Pollock, seeing her tiny outback Northern Territory community hit by floods from a swelling Victoria River twice in less than a year has proved a difficult pill to swallow.  ""It was terrible, devastating you know?"" the Bilinara and Mudburra woman said.  ""Repeating the trauma again.  ""After the flood last year, I lost a lot of my stuff from my house.""  Anne Pollock says the flooding events have been ""devastating"" for residents. ( ABC News: Evelyn Manfield )  Dozens of residents were evacuated from Pigeon Hole — also known as Nitjpurru — earlier this month, as the river hit a 30-year peak of 24 metres, during a deluge from the tropical monsoon.  Located more than 700 kilometres south of Darwin and built on a flood plain, residents and local authorities have been calling for Pigeon Hole to be relocated to higher ground for decades.  Mayor of the Victoria Daly Regional Council Brian Pedwell has been raising his voice over the issue to the NT government for years, so far to no avail.  ""I'm very angry. I've been angry for the last 20 years to relocate that community,"" he said.  ""Those departments, when are they going to look at themselves deeply and relocate that infrastructure … how many more times that community gonna flood?""  Brian Pedwell has spent years pushing the NT government to move Pigeon Hole to higher ground. ( ABC News: Mike Donnelly )  Government says it supports relocating Pigeon Hole  NT Chief Minister Eva Lawler denied that the government had long ignored the requests of Pigeon Hole residents to relocate, and said negotiations were underway with a nearby cattle station for access to higher land.  ""There is an absolute will to do that [relocation],"" Ms Lawler said.  ""These things cost money, and it is moving a whole community, and you know, there are people that have lived there for a very long time.""  She didn't commit to a firm timeline and said there could be compensation involved with the move.  ""With the pastoralists, you know, there will need to be land that'll be excised, it might involve compensation, and then it will be around that process of moving,"" she said.  Some of the houses sit on short stilts, but residents say it's not enough to escape floodwaters. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  The NT government built more houses on the flood plain in 2018. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  Founded by Australia's first billionaire, Robert Holmes à Court, Heytesbury Pastoral owns the Victoria River Downs station next to Pigeon Hole.  Station general manager Rusty Richter said the station had ""no objections"" to excising part of the station land for the town, but that they'd received very little information from the NT government.  ""Heytesbury's got no objections to it, we're happy to negotiate with them and talk to them to work in with the elders and government officials,"" Mr Richter said.  He said while the company had entered into discussions with the NT government and Northern Land Council (NLC) over excising part of their land, he was now awaiting the next move from government.  ""From our side of it, we've replied to the government,"" he said.  ""The ball's in their court.""  The NLC has also voiced its frustration over the slow pace of negotiations.  Pigeon Hole residents used boats to travel through floodwaters earlier in January. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  Part of the reason for not moving sooner, the government says, is because in previous years some Pigeon Hole residents have said they wanted to stay where they are.  ""I think with anything, you'll find that there'll be people who don't want to move,"" Ms Lawler said.  ""But it is an ongoing conversation.  ""I think the flood last year … they hadn't had a flood for a long time, then this second one is probably now making people think very carefully around the situation they're in.""  Ms Pollock was among residents who told the ABC there was now unison within the community about wanting to move to higher ground.  Residents say they are worried about flooding every year. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  Footage shows accommodation flooded  Less than 12 months since the Victoria River last broke its banks, the temporary accommodation that had been trucked in for workers helping to rebuild the community was this month inundated.  Over the past year, the NT government has spent more than $11 million repairing and replacing flood-inundated homes in the communities of Pigeon Hole, Kalkarindji and Dagaragu.  Portable buildings installed by the NT government last year have already flooded. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  Power was cut during flooding earlier this month. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  Mr Pedwell is among those to question why the NT government would build and bring new infrastructure into the flood plain on Pigeon Hole, rather than make plans to relocate.  ""Half-built houses have been inundated with floodwater as we speak,"" Mr Pedwell said.  ""No new infrastructure is being done up on the higher ground – if there was, I wouldn't be talking to you, I wouldn't be advocating on the community's behalf.""  Gurindji leader Rob Roy described building the homes in Pigeon Hole as ""money down the drain every year"".  ""I don't know how much a house cost to build, about $500,000?"" he said.  ""Build a few of those every year that get washed away, what's the government doing?""  Rob Roy says the NT government is wasting money by continuing to build homes in a flood zone. ( ABC News: Hamish Harty )  Mr Richter also said he was ""shocked"" to see new homes being built.  ""I was quite shocked to see them start building new houses [on the flood plain],"" he said.  ""In all honesty, it's a waste of our taxpayer's money.""  Ms Lawler defended placing the accommodation back in Pigeon Hole's flood zone.  ""You know, that's where the community is, and that's probably been there for a very, very long time,"" she said.  ""So it was about upgrading and the new houses were houses that were built with a large slab, so that was above the flood levels.""  Several houses are under construction on the flood plain. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  The Department of Infrastructure said the ""contractor's accommodation received some inundation from the floodwaters"" this month.  ""The temporary accommodation being utilised by the community residents were not impacted by floodwaters,"" a spokesperson said.  ""Some materials for the new homes [currently being built] have received damage from the floodwater, however, the extent of this is still to be determined as the contractors are yet to return to the community.""  'If only the government listened to us'  Pigeon Hole resident Jocelyn Victor said some people had been pushing to relocate the community since 2001 when major flooding prompted the NT government to move the local power station and airstrip to higher ground.  ""It's not fair,"" she said.  Jocelyn Victor with her partner Raymond Hector in Pigeon Hole. ( Supplied: Raymond Hector )  ""It's terrible leaving us in the flood zone.""  Ms Victor said she was still traumatised by last year's major flooding event, which destroyed residents' houses and swept away precious belongings.  She hasn't seen her pet dog since.  ""We've lived so many years in our own houses and losing everything just like that, it hurt terribly,"" she said.  After the devastation from last year, Ms Victor chose to stay behind at a makeshift shelter near Pigeon Hole this time rather than join the evacuees in Darwin.  She said it's not a choice residents should have to make each wet season.  ""It would make it easier if the government moved the school, the shop and the clinic up to higher ground — and the housing — instead of sending people away from their home,"" she said.  About 30 people stayed at a temporary flood shelter near Pigeon Hole during the most recent flooding.

""The future for our younger generation isn't looking good if the government keeps building houses in the flood zone area.""

9,https://www.miragenews.com/australia-eagerly-awaiting-powerball-200m-draw-1163547/,"As Australia eagerly anticipates the Powerball's $200 million draw on Thursday night, the nation is abuzz with the possibility of life-changing moments. This record jackpot, the largest in Australian lottery history, has captured the imagination of countless individuals dreaming of the instant their lives could transform with a single phone call from lotto officials.  This draw, unprecedented in its magnitude, follows six consecutive draws without a division one winner. With up to half of Australian adults expected to participate, the draw is set to be a historic event.  Ahead of Thursday night’s heart-stopping Powerball draw, The Lott has showcased some of the awe-inspiring moments when previous division one winners discovered their wins.  The $200 million prize is the biggest jackpot offered by any Australian lottery game in history. It comes after no player held all seven winning numbers and the all-important Powerball number needed to win the division one prize in the past six consecutive draws.  Up to half of Australian adults are expected to have an entry into the draw, vying for the chance to become a newly minted multi-millionaire.  The Lott spokesperson Anna Hobdell said a tapestry of emotions often unfold when delivering the news of a division one windfall.  “Behind every winning lottery call, there’s a person on the other end of the line with a story to tell.

Key points: Godfreys has entered voluntary administration while looking for a potential buyer for the vacuum cleaner retailer  Godfreys has entered voluntary administration while looking for a potential buyer for the vacuum cleaner retailer The business has struggled with maintaining its profitability due to reduced customer demand and higher operational costs  The business has struggled with maintaining its profitability due to reduced customer demand and higher operational costs Administrators expect 54 Godfreys stores will close within the fortnight, affecting 193 jobs in Australia and New Zealand  Since its establishment in 1931, Godfreys evolved to become one of the world's biggest vacuum cleaner retailers, and operates 141 stores employing more than 600 people across Australia and New Zealand.  On Tuesday afternoon, Godfreys announced it had entered voluntary administration, appointing PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to oversee the process.  In a statement, the administrators said the Godfreys business would continue to trade while it undergoes an ""immediate"" restructure of its operations, which is expected to result in the closure of 54 stores and loss of 193 staff in the next 14 days.  ""Like many retailers, Godfreys has faced a challenging economic and operating environment,"" administrator Craig Crosbie said.  ""Lower customer demand amid cost of living pressures, higher operating costs, and increased competition have all taken a toll on profitability, with some stores more impacted than others.  ""Our aim is to move quickly to restructure Godfreys to preserve as much of the business and as many jobs as possible.""  Mr Crosbie said the administrators would also seek a buyer for the business while keeping the remaining stores operational.  ""We intend to trade the restructured store network and sell the business and assets as a going concern, with strong interest expected from prospective buyers,"" he said.  ""We will continue to work closely with Godfreys' director, management, and creditors, including staff whose employment is unfortunately impacted by store closures.""  In a statement, Godfreys' director Grant Hancock said it was a ""difficult"" decision to place the business into administration.  ""While the decision to appoint administrators was difficult, it was made with the best interests of Godfreys' employees, customers and broader stakeholders in mind,"" he said.  Administrators will hold their first creditors meeting on February 9.  Administrators expect there will be ""strong interest"" for Godfreys from prospective buyers. ( Facebook: Godfreys )  A brand built on a bowling ball  The eponymous retailer was founded in Melbourne by Godfrey Cohen at a time when vacuum cleaners were exclusively sold by door-to-door salesmen in Australia.  In 1931, Mr Cohen spent $50 — the equivalent of $2,700 today — to purchase 30 vacuum cleaners from the auction columns of a newspaper, and displayed them in the window of his family's furniture shop.  Five years later, Mr Cohen struck a deal with businessman John Johnston and the pair opened the first Godfreys store in Melbourne's Prahran Market.  The retailer gradually expanded to other locations and became a vacuum retailing empire, with more than 220 stores locations across Australia and New Zealand at its peak.  Godfreys became well-known for its advertising campaigns in the 1990s starring its chief executive, John Hardy, who famously demonstrated the strength and suction power of vacuum cleaners by picking up a 7-kilogram bowling ball.  YouTube Godfreys' bowling ball advertisement demonstrated a vacuum's suction by having it pick up a 7kg bowling ball.  Mr Cohen died in 2004 at the age of 95, and the company was sold to private equity firms Pacific Equity Partners and Unitas Capital in 2006 for $350 million.  In 2014, Godfreys became a publicly listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange, but falling sales, increased competition, senior management changes and a waning share price resulted in the company being taken private four years later.  Mr Johnston bought back the vacuum cleaner retailer he founded in mid-2018 for $13.7 million, and died months later aged 100.  At the time of his death, Mr Hardy said one of the reasons Mr Johnston bought back the company he co-founded ""was because he could see a great long-term future for the business under private ownership"".","Vacuum cleaner retail chain Godfreys enters voluntary administration amid 'challenging' economic conditions - ABC News This site uses cookies The ABC uses cookies to improve your experience.

NSW Police are offering a $500,000 reward to help solve the suspected murder of a Sydney man, gunned down on his way to Canberra almost 40 years ago. They say the murder may have been ""politically motivated"".  They say the murder may have been ""politically motivated"". What's next? Police are hoping anyone with information about the case, or who was in the car with Mr Djordjevic on his way to Canberra, to come forward.  New South Wales police have appealed for information in what they have called a ""last throw of the dice"" to solve a nearly 40-year-old cold case murder.  On January 26, 1985, western Sydney resident Radojko Djordjevic left home to meet his wife and some of his children at the Bojic church festival in Canberra.  When he failed to show up, his wife reported him missing to police.  A newspaper clipping published following the murder. ( Supplied: NSW Police )  Five days later, police found his decomposed body near the Hume Highway at Marulan.  He had been shot three times in the neck and chest.  A coronial report found he had likely died between 9.30pm on Thursday January 24 and 11am on Thursday January 31, 1985.  Ever since, his family, including daughter Gana, has been searching for answers.  ""I had just turned 21 when our father was brutally bashed and then shot three times – my brother Dragan was 19, Milan was 13 and Miladin was 10,"" Ms Djordevic said.  ""I am 60 now, and we are desperately still seeking closure to the continuous grieving, suffering and insecurity caused by my father's death.""  'Political motivations'  Today, NSW Police announced a $500,000 reward for information regarding Mr Djordjevic's murder.  They said they believed the killing ""may have been politically motivated"", and related to a ""political power struggle"" within Serbian organisations in NSW at the time.  Mr Djordjevic was said to be a prominent member of western Sydney's Serbian community at the time of his death.  He was the president of both the Free Serbian Orthodox Church and the Old Toongabbie branch of the Liberal Party.  Mr Djordjevic's daughter Gana said the family held suspicions about who her father was in the car with around the time of his death.  Radojko Djordjevic's children are still seeking answers to his murder. ( Supplied: NSW Police )  ""My father was unlicenced at the time of his killing, which tells us he wasn't driving a car and the person or persons responsible for this is someone we may have considered family friends,"" she said.  NSW Police Detective Acting Superintendent Virginia Gorman said that information was crucial to their investigation.  ""Our information is that he potentially was picked up by people in a car and taken into Canberra,"" she said.  ""We've not definitely identified who those people may be, so anybody in that car could be of particular interest, or anybody who was in that car who wants to come forward and tell us about what happened, it'd be much appreciated.""  Ms Gorman said now was the time to appeal to the public to come forward before those with information died.  ""It's 39 years since this occurred, members of the family are getting older, members of the public who might have information about this are also getting older,"" she said.  ""So at a time like now you offer reward, it might be the time when we're really a long way distance from those internal conflicts that maybe people will now be happier to talk about what was going on at the time, and who may have been involved.""

( Supplied: NSW Police )  A man was arrested in 2003 and charged with Mr Djordjevic's murder, but was later acquitted.  NSW Police Minister Yasmin Catley said there was still hope the case could be solved.

Lauren O'Neill, 29, was bitten on the leg near a private wharf in Sydney Harbour on Monday evening. Locals residents administered first aid after hearing Ms O'Neill call for help. She was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. Authorities believe a bull shark is responsible for the attack, based on photographs of the bite marks. Sydney Harbour is a well-known habitat for the species, but attacks in the area are rare. Neighbour Michael Porter told the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) he heard a ""soft yell"" for help outside his window around 20:00 local time (09:00 GMT). He looked outside to see Ms O'Neill hanging on to a ladder on the wharf in Elizabeth Bay, an inner-city suburb. ""She was trying to climb in and behind her was her leg, which was completely open and full of dark red blood behind her,"" Mr Porter said. Another local described how her wife, who is a vet, applied a tourniquet to stem the bleeding. ""She basically bandaged it up. The bone's broken and it's pretty hectic actually,"" Georgia Singleton told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. One witness told the SMH she regularly sees sharks swimming under the jetty. ""I always thought it was a matter of time,"" she said. In 2009, former navy diver Paul de Gelder was left without an arm and a leg after he was attacked by a bull shark during a counter-terrorism exercise in Sydney Harbour. Australia has more shark attacks than any other country except the US, but fatal attacks are uncommon. There were 14 shark attacks in 2023, according to the Australian Shark-Incident Database, four of them lethal.

On Tuesday, the New South Wales state coroner, Teresa O’Sullivan, suspended the inquest into the death of Dunghutti teenager Jai Kalani Wright and referred the case to the DPP.  Wright, 16, died while riding in Eveleigh in February 2022.  The inquest, which had only started on Monday and was set down for two weeks, was expected to investigate issues including the roles played by police officers in the collision and whether it was appropriate for them to attempt to stop Wright, the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), which was representing Wright’s parents in the proceedings, said.  In a statement, Wright’s parents, Lachlan Wright and Kylie Aloua, asked family and friends to respect the referral process.  “Almost 2 years ago, we received a call, one of the calls that as a parent you never want to receive, about Jai having an accident. We rushed straight to the hospital and we were by our son’s side as he passed away.  “Ever since then, we have been searching for the truth. We need to know the truth so that we can live our lives and move forward.  “This referral has given us a lot of hope, we have faith that we will get justice for Jai. I would just ask all our family and friends to let this process play out … and believe that at the end we will get our truth and get our justice.”  View image in fullscreen Lachlan Wright (right) embraces supporters after the inquest into Jai’s death was suspended and referred to the DPP. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP  Karly Warner, the CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), said that Wright was one of at least 558 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have died in custody and police operations in three decades since the royal commission.  “Scrutiny and accountability are essential in stopping this national shame,” Warner said.  “The Aboriginal Legal Service is proud to stand alongside Jai Wright’s family and community.

1,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/qld-heatwave-death-ambulance-natural-disasters-hot-weather-humid/103400540,"Heatwaves increase the likelihood of ambulance call-outs in Australia by about 10 per cent, putting even more pressure on already stretched hospital emergency departments, new research has found.  With climate change expected to fuel more extreme heatwaves in coming years, Griffith University public health expert Shannon Rutherford has called for the development of a whole-of-government task force to prepare Australians for the impacts.  Queensland is in the midst of a heatwave. ( AAP: Jason O'Brien )  Her plea comes amid increasing evidence heatwaves cause the deaths of more people in Australia than any other natural disaster.  Dr Rutherford co-authored an analysis of eight Australian studies, published between January 2011 and May 2023, into the impact of heatwaves on ambulance services.  The research found a significant spike in triple-0 calls during prolonged high temperatures, with a 5 per cent increase concerning cardiovascular issues alone.  ""What we're seeing is that people are dying when it's hotter, and it's often related to an underlying chronic disease, which is why we're also seeing those cardiovascular call-outs as a very significant part of that story around impact on ambulances,"" Dr Rutherford said.  She said Australia, at a community and public policy level, needed to find ways to mitigate the effects of heatwaves to alleviate growing pressure on an over-burdened health system, including ambulance ramping.  The new study, published on Monday in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, comes as oppressive heatwave conditions continue across much of Queensland.  Last week, the mercury rose to 49.4 degrees Celsius in the Queensland outback town of Birdsville, the state's hottest January temperature in recorded history.  It was just shy of the Sunshine State's highest temperature since records began – 49.5C, also in Birdsville, on Christmas Eve in 1972.  Queensland Health has also issued a warning about an extreme heatwave impacting the state’s north and far north until Thursday.  Severe heatwave conditions are expected for Queensland’s central coast, Whitsundays, Wide Bay, and Burnett regions.  Locations most likely to be impacted include Cairns, Townsville, Bowen, Ingham, Mackay, Yeppoon, Gladstone, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay.  Unsurprisingly, the study found ambulance call-outs rose more as the intensity of heatwaves increased.  ""The aging population, growing prevalence of chronic diseases, and increased incidence of other extreme weather events in the country due to climate change is already pushing the healthcare system to its capacity,"" the researchers wrote.  ""Australia has been experiencing droughts, bushfires, and floods over the past few decades, and with COVID-19 the system is facing significant issues of workforce and infrastructure shortages and staff fatigue.  ""The increased projection for heatwaves for Australia has the potential to add on to the already at-capacity Australian healthcare system.""  Climate change is expected to fuel more extreme heatwaves in coming years. ( ABC News: Christopher Gillette )  Action needed, researchers say  Dr Rutherford said Australia, as a society, needed to be developing multiple strategies to tackle the likelihood of increasing heatwaves into the future, including policies to address the impact on hospitals.  ""We need a whole-of-government approach to be thinking about how we design our houses, how we design our cities, how we provide cool spaces to those who don't have access to cooling like air conditioning, how we can improve individual and community awareness of heat as a health risk,"" she said.  ""We need to work with our architects and planners and local governments about how we can start putting into our planning schemes some better consideration of heat in the urban environment.  ""We really need to join the dots and get people and agencies working together to prevent what we know is an impact now, and will continue to be an impact as we see climate projections realised.""  Mehak Oberai is the lead author of the study, which explores the effects of heatwaves and the likelihood of ambulance call-outs. ( Supplied )  Lead author of the study Mehak Oberai, of Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry, said the findings of the study highlighted why heatwaves were known as ""silent killers"" and underscored the need for Australians to be better prepared to face heat-related challenges.  The study authors cited a previous review of coronial records detailing heatwave fatalities in Australia in 2001-2018.  That review, published in 2022, listed 354 heatwave-related deaths.  As temperatures rise, more ambulances are called out to heat-related jobs. ( ABC News: Curtis Rodda )  ""Most indoor heatwave fatalities occurred in older housing stock,"" the review found.  It said the risk of dying in a heatwave increased with age, socio-economic disadvantage, social isolation, geographical remoteness, the presence of physical or mental disabilities, some prescribed medication, and the absence or non-use of air conditioning.  Ms Oberai called for more research into heatwave risk, which could reduce the health burden through improved prevention.","Already stretched hospitals take on more ambulance call-outs in heatwaves, new Griffith University research finds - ABC News This site uses cookies The ABC uses cookies to improve your experience.

""We need a whole-of-government approach to be thinking about how we design our houses, how we design our cities, how we provide cool spaces to those who don't have access to cooling like air conditioning, how we can improve individual and community awareness of heat as a health risk,"" she said. ""We need to work with our architects and planners and local governments about how we can start putting into our planning schemes some better consideration of heat in the urban environment. ""We really need to join the dots and get people and agencies working together to prevent what we know is an impact now, and will continue to be an impact as we see climate projections realised."" Mehak Oberai is the lead author of the study, which explores the effects of heatwaves and the likelihood of ambulance call-outs. ( Supplied ) Lead author of the study Mehak Oberai, of Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry, said the findings of the study highlighted why heatwaves were known as ""silent killers"" and underscored the need for Australians to be better prepared to face heat-related challenges. The study authors cited a previous review of coronial records detailing heatwave fatalities in Australia in 2001-2018. That review, published in 2022, listed 354 heatwave-related deaths. As temperatures rise, more ambulances are called out to heat-related jobs. ( ABC News: Curtis Rodda ) ""Most indoor heatwave fatalities occurred in older housing stock,"" the review found. It said the risk of dying in a heatwave increased with age, socio-economic disadvantage, social isolation, geographical remoteness, the presence of physical or mental disabilities, some prescribed medication, and the absence or non-use of air conditioning. Ms Oberai called for more research into heatwave risk, which could reduce the health burden through improved prevention.

7,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/29/asbestos-nsw-findings-watchdog-epa-contaminated-soil-childcare-centres-schools-parks,"The New South Wales environmental regulator has known for more than a decade that producers of soil fill made from construction and demolition waste were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community.  Internal documents from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), obtained by Guardian Australia, warned widespread breaches by industry meant potentially contaminated product might have been applied to land across the state, including at childcare centres, residential areas, schools and parks.  But the regulator walked away from a proposal to tighten regulations in 2022 after it received pushback from the waste industry warning the policy changes would force up the cost of landfill disposal, drive more waste into landfill and force skip bin companies out of business.  Soil fill could contain asbestos fibres  The potentially contaminated product, known as “recovered fines”, is a soil or sand substitute made from the processing of construction and demolition waste, including skip bin residue, after all large recyclable material has been removed.  It is a different product from the contaminated mulch recently found in Rozelle parklands. But experts say that unlike the bonded asbestos found in Rozelle, which is relatively harmless unless broken apart, recovered fines could contain asbestos fibres, which pose a greater risk to human health.  “Fibrous asbestos poses risk [because] inhalation can take it into your lungs and the fibres then get stuck in the lungs. It doesn’t go away,” said Prof Ravi Naidu, an internationally recognised expert in soil pollution from the University of Newcastle.  Waste facilities in NSW produce about 700,000 tonnes of recovered fines each year for application on land including landscaping, sporting fields and residential developments, according to the EPA. The product is not allowed to be used on agricultural land or around water infrastructure.  View image in fullscreen NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP  “The community will be rightly outraged that the profitability of industry appears to have been put above community safety by the EPA,” said the NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty, whose seat of Balmain takes in the Rozelle parklands where bonded asbestos was discovered in mulch.  “If you look at the evidence, it’s pretty compelling that there’s a large problem.”  Widespread breaches  Documents released through government information public access laws as part of a Guardian Australia investigation show two enforcement investigations by the regulator – one in 2013 and one in 2019 – found widespread breaches by waste facilities of regulations that require producers of recovered fines to make sure their product is safe for reuse in the community.  Under NSW resource recovery regulations, producers of the processed waste must ensure their product does not exceed limits on contaminants such as lead, cadmium, plastics and glass.  There is no requirement they test specifically for asbestos.  View image in fullscreen Asbestos was found in mulch surrounding a playground at Rozelle parklands. Photograph: Peter Hannam  The detailed results of the EPA’s investigations have not been released previously and include a finding in 2013 that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations.  In a follow-up investigation in 2019, the EPA reviewed about 50,000 pieces of testing and sampling data from 21 waste facilities and found 71% had exceeded the absolute maximum concentration limit for a chemical or physical contaminant at least once over a two-year period, with the most frequent breaches identified for metals, glass and rigid plastics, pH levels and lead.  More than half of samples contained asbestos  The NSW regulations for recovered fines do not require facilities to test for asbestos and the 2019 review found only 29% of facilities had requested asbestos testing.  In a second stage of that investigation, the EPA took its own samples at 14 facilities. That round of testing, according to an EPA industry presentation, found 57% of facilities had asbestos in their recovered fines.  Some of the EPA’s findings from its 2019 investigation relating to poor industry compliance, including the asbestos contamination, were made public by the regulator in 2022 when it proposed a series of reforms.  The documents show that between 2013 and 2022, the EPA gave extensive consideration to tightening regulations based on the findings of its enforcement campaigns.  One preliminary analysis of potential options highlighted the potential risks of a business-as-usual approach by pointing to the 2013 finding that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations.  “This means that up to 658,000 tonnes (94% of 700,000 tonnes) of material produced annually may not have complied with the order,” the document states.  “This non-compliant material may be applied on sensitive land uses such as residential, child care facilities, schools and parks.”  Children at risk  A spokesperson for the EPA told Guardian Australia the human health and environmental risks associated with recovered fines were low because the products were “generally used in low-contact situations, such as engineering fill and pipe bedding”.  The community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm. Prof Mark Taylor  But Mark Taylor, an honorary professor at Macquarie University who specialises in environmental contamination, said “the ultimate end use of recovered soils and fines is unknown”.  He said the products “could end up being used in the most sensitive environments involving young children under the age of five”.  Small children have a lower body mass index and are more likely to put things in their mouth so pollutants pose a greater risk to their health, experts say.  “If you’re going to have unfettered use of these products, you need to have the most conservative standards applied to the materials in order to protect human health where the risk is greatest,” Taylor said.  “To not do so means the industry is complicit and wilfully contaminating the environment.”  View image in fullscreen Signs and barricades at Rozelle parklands on 10 January. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP  Taylor acknowledged the recovery and processing of waste for new uses was a “herculean task”, but said the public needed to know that products were safe and fit for purpose.  “While it is critical that resources are reused and recycled wherever possible to assist in meeting sustainable outcomes, the community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm.”  Proposed changes  According to the documents obtained by Guardian Australia, the EPA considered a tough approach that involved revoking the existing regulations for recovered fines and introducing site-specific ones, which would have meant the material could not be applied to land as a soil or sand substitute or for landscaping purposes unless a facility demonstrated its recovered fines were high quality.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another option, later put to industry, was tougher “batch” regulations that would require facilities to receive the results from sampling and testing before products went out to third parties.  The EPA also considered introducing rules for asbestos testing and discussed limiting the application of soil fill products derived from recovered fines to construction works “at depth”, prohibiting their use in landscaping.  The management of asbestos in recovered fines remains under review by the state’s chief scientist.  The EPA put its proposal to industry in late 2021 that it intended to revoke the general orders and exemptions that allowed broad use of recovered fines on land in favour of new rules that would allow for their use where high-quality product could be demonstrated.  But this was abandoned in 2022 after significant industry objections and negative media coverage.  Pressure from industry  According to the NSW government, industry raised “significant concerns” with the proposed changes, including that they would be challenging to comply with and could impose significant costs that would be passed on to skip bin customers, as well as reduce recycling and recovery rates and increase illegal dumping.  One letter from multiple skip bin companies, released to Guardian Australia, said negative impacts would include a substantial increase in landfill fees, construction cost increases, flow-on effects for landscapers, small renovators and “everyday mums and dads”, and “most small rubbish removal and skip bin businesses will be forced to close leaving Bingo to monopolise the industry”.  In an email in May 2022, the EPA’s acting chief executive Jacqueleine Moore told stakeholders that the regulator had “heard the concerns of the waste and resource recovery industry, small businesses, and the construction industry”.  “Following this consultation, the EPA will not move ahead with the proposed changes to the rules governing how recovered fines are managed and recycled,” the email said.  “The existing recovered fines orders and exemptions will remain in place. The EPA will instead focus on waste industry education, monitoring and compliance to improve environmental outcomes.”  I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty  A former employee of the EPA, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said: “A lot of people within the EPA who worked on this policy were actually really angry that we backflipped.  “They felt really let down because they had done all of this work, there had been a lot of policy work, science work, that had been done over a long period of time and they had a lot of evidence.”  Shetty said the backdown was “a clear case of regulatory failure”. “I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here,” she said.  Part of a ‘circular economy’  The construction and demolition industry generates more than 12m tonnes of waste annually in NSW, which makes up more than half of all waste generated in the state. Recovered fines account for approximately 3% of NSW’s annual waste, according to the EPA’s spokesperson, and about half of the estimated 700,000 tonnes generated each year “is clean, uncontaminated soil”.  In their feedback to the EPA the peak industry bodies the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association (WMRR) and the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association said they were “categorically opposed” to the EPA’s proposal to revoke the regulations covering recovered fines “given the important role that it plays in ensuring construction material is circulated within the NSW economy and environment, and in doing so, reduces the reliance on virgin material while creating jobs and investment in NSW”.  They described the findings in the EPA’s 2019 investigation as “flawed” because they were made before construction facility guidelines were introduced that had improved facility practices and the “quality and consistency of this material”.  They said the impacts on people or the environment of foreign materials in recovered fines were “likely to be extremely limited given that these materials are already widely present in the environment”.  Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of WMRR, said recovered fines were often used as a base for roads and other construction projects and were capped by other materials. She said industry wanted the regulator to take an approach to contaminants that matched the products’ intended use.  “As an industry, we are 100% committed to making a safe product,” she said. “What we didn’t want was to put a valuable product into landfill.”  She said more needed to be done to correctly classify waste at its source to ensure only materials that could be safely recycled made their way to recycling facilities.  The EPA’s spokesperson said the regulator was “committed to protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health while driving a circular economy”.  “The use of good quality clean soil excavated from construction activities is a great example of a circular economy that reuses waste resources efficiently and productively.”  They said in October last year the regulator had commenced another “campaign to assess compliance with the resource recovery order, including site inspections and collecting samples for testing”.  The compliance campaign would be completed by the end of April this year and would “inform further regulatory action, and reform of the resource recovery framework” in line with recommendations from a 2021 independent review by Dr Cathy Wilkinson.  “Our work will be further guided later this year by a NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer report commissioned to provide advice on the management of asbestos in recovered fines, and CSIRO/EPA research currently underway on microplastics, chemically treated timbers and synthetic mineral fibres,” the spokesperson said.  These reports are expected later in 2024.","NSW watchdog failed to act on contamination risk despite ‘damning’ asbestos findings | New South Wales | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 4 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Environment Climate crisis Wildlife Energy Pollution Contaminants such as asbestos and lead have been found in soil samples tested by the EPA.

Composite: Getty Images New South Wales NSW watchdog failed to act on contamination risk despite ‘damning’ asbestos findings Exclusive : environmental regulator has known for more than a decade that contaminated soil fill might have been used in childcare centres, schools and parks Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast Lisa Cox , Catie McLeod and Tamsin Rose Sun 28 Jan 2024 14.00 GMT Last modified on Mon 29 Jan 2024 23.54 GMT The New South Wales environmental regulator has known for more than a decade that producers of soil fill made from construction and demolition waste were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community. Internal documents from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), obtained by Guardian Australia, warned widespread breaches by industry meant potentially contaminated product might have been applied to land across the state, including at childcare centres, residential areas, schools and parks. But the regulator walked away from a proposal to tighten regulations in 2022 after it received pushback from the waste industry warning the policy changes would force up the cost of landfill disposal, drive more waste into landfill and force skip bin companies out of business. Asbestos found in mulch at new sites across Sydney following earlier Rozelle parklands discovery Read more Soil fill could contain asbestos fibres The potentially contaminated product, known as “recovered fines”, is a soil or sand substitute made from the processing of construction and demolition waste, including skip bin residue, after all large recyclable material has been removed. It is a different product from the contaminated mulch recently found in Rozelle parklands . But experts say that unlike the bonded asbestos found in Rozelle, which is relatively harmless unless broken apart, recovered fines could contain asbestos fibres, which pose a greater risk to human health. “Fibrous asbestos poses risk [because] inhalation can take it into your lungs and the fibres then get stuck in the lungs. It doesn’t go away,” said Prof Ravi Naidu, an internationally recognised expert in soil pollution from the University of Newcastle. Waste facilities in NSW produce about 700,000 tonnes of recovered fines each year for application on land including landscaping, sporting fields and residential developments, according to the EPA. The product is not allowed to be used on agricultural land or around water infrastructure. View image in fullscreen NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP “The community will be rightly outraged that the profitability of industry appears to have been put above community safety by the EPA,” said the NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty, whose seat of Balmain takes in the Rozelle parklands where bonded asbestos was discovered in mulch. “If you look at the evidence, it’s pretty compelling that there’s a large problem.” Widespread breaches Documents released through government information public access laws as part of a Guardian Australia investigation show two enforcement investigations by the regulator – one in 2013 and one in 2019 – found widespread breaches by waste facilities of regulations that require producers of recovered fines to make sure their product is safe for reuse in the community. Under NSW resource recovery regulations, producers of the processed waste must ensure their product does not exceed limits on contaminants such as lead, cadmium, plastics and glass. There is no requirement they test specifically for asbestos. View image in fullscreen Asbestos was found in mulch surrounding a playground at Rozelle parklands. Photograph: Peter Hannam The detailed results of the EPA’s investigations have not been released previously and include a finding in 2013 that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations. In a follow-up investigation in 2019, the EPA reviewed about 50,000 pieces of testing and sampling data from 21 waste facilities and found 71% had exceeded the absolute maximum concentration limit for a chemical or physical contaminant at least once over a two-year period, with the most frequent breaches identified for metals, glass and rigid plastics, pH levels and lead. More than half of samples contained asbestos The NSW regulations for recovered fines do not require facilities to test for asbestos and the 2019 review found only 29% of facilities had requested asbestos testing. In a second stage of that investigation, the EPA took its own samples at 14 facilities. That round of testing, according to an EPA industry presentation, found 57% of facilities had asbestos in their recovered fines. Some of the EPA’s findings from its 2019 investigation relating to poor industry compliance, including the asbestos contamination, were made public by the regulator in 2022 when it proposed a series of reforms. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The documents show that between 2013 and 2022, the EPA gave extensive consideration to tightening regulations based on the findings of its enforcement campaigns. One preliminary analysis of potential options highlighted the potential risks of a business-as-usual approach by pointing to the 2013 finding that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations. “This means that up to 658,000 tonnes (94% of 700,000 tonnes) of material produced annually may not have complied with the order,” the document states. “This non-compliant material may be applied on sensitive land uses such as residential, child care facilities, schools and parks.” Children at risk A spokesperson for the EPA told Guardian Australia the human health and environmental risks associated with recovered fines were low because the products were “generally used in low-contact situations, such as engineering fill and pipe bedding”. The community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm. Prof Mark Taylor But Mark Taylor, an honorary professor at Macquarie University who specialises in environmental contamination, said “the ultimate end use of recovered soils and fines is unknown”. He said the products “could end up being used in the most sensitive environments involving young children under the age of five”. Small children have a lower body mass index and are more likely to put things in their mouth so pollutants pose a greater risk to their health, experts say. “If you’re going to have unfettered use of these products, you need to have the most conservative standards applied to the materials in order to protect human health where the risk is greatest,” Taylor said. “To not do so means the industry is complicit and wilfully contaminating the environment.” View image in fullscreen Signs and barricades at Rozelle parklands on 10 January. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP Taylor acknowledged the recovery and processing of waste for new uses was a “herculean task”, but said the public needed to know that products were safe and fit for purpose. “While it is critical that resources are reused and recycled wherever possible to assist in meeting sustainable outcomes, the community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm.” Proposed changes According to the documents obtained by Guardian Australia, the EPA considered a tough approach that involved revoking the existing regulations for recovered fines and introducing site-specific ones, which would have meant the material could not be applied to land as a soil or sand substitute or for landscaping purposes unless a facility demonstrated its recovered fines were high quality. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another option, later put to industry, was tougher “batch” regulations that would require facilities to receive the results from sampling and testing before products went out to third parties. The EPA also considered introducing rules for asbestos testing and discussed limiting the application of soil fill products derived from recovered fines to construction works “at depth”, prohibiting their use in landscaping. The management of asbestos in recovered fines remains under review by the state’s chief scientist. The EPA put its proposal to industry in late 2021 that it intended to revoke the general orders and exemptions that allowed broad use of recovered fines on land in favour of new rules that would allow for their use where high-quality product could be demonstrated. But this was abandoned in 2022 after significant industry objections and negative media coverage. Pressure from industry According to the NSW government , industry raised “significant concerns” with the proposed changes, including that they would be challenging to comply with and could impose significant costs that would be passed on to skip bin customers, as well as reduce recycling and recovery rates and increase illegal dumping. One letter from multiple skip bin companies, released to Guardian Australia, said negative impacts would include a substantial increase in landfill fees, construction cost increases, flow-on effects for landscapers, small renovators and “everyday mums and dads”, and “most small rubbish removal and skip bin businesses will be forced to close leaving Bingo to monopolise the industry”. In an email in May 2022, the EPA’s acting chief executive Jacqueleine Moore told stakeholders that the regulator had “heard the concerns of the waste and resource recovery industry, small businesses, and the construction industry”. “Following this consultation, the EPA will not move ahead with the proposed changes to the rules governing how recovered fines are managed and recycled,” the email said. “The existing recovered fines orders and exemptions will remain in place. The EPA will instead focus on waste industry education, monitoring and compliance to improve environmental outcomes.” I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty A former employee of the EPA, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said: “A lot of people within the EPA who worked on this policy were actually really angry that we backflipped. “They felt really let down because they had done all of this work, there had been a lot of policy work, science work, that had been done over a long period of time and they had a lot of evidence.” Shetty said the backdown was “a clear case of regulatory failure”. “I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here,” she said. Part of a ‘circular economy’ The construction and demolition industry generates more than 12m tonnes of waste annually in NSW, which makes up more than half of all waste generated in the state. Recovered fines account for approximately 3% of NSW’s annual waste, according to the EPA’s spokesperson, and about half of the estimated 700,000 tonnes generated each year “is clean, uncontaminated soil”. In their feedback to the EPA the peak industry bodies the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association (WMRR) and the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association said they were “categorically opposed” to the EPA’s proposal to revoke the regulations covering recovered fines “given the important role that it plays in ensuring construction material is circulated within the NSW economy and environment, and in doing so, reduces the reliance on virgin material while creating jobs and investment in NSW”. They described the findings in the EPA’s 2019 investigation as “flawed” because they were made before construction facility guidelines were introduced that had improved facility practices and the “quality and consistency of this material”. They said the impacts on people or the environment of foreign materials in recovered fines were “likely to be extremely limited given that these materials are already widely present in the environment”. Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of WMRR, said recovered fines were often used as a base for roads and other construction projects and were capped by other materials. She said industry wanted the regulator to take an approach to contaminants that matched the products’ intended use. Australia’s plan to phase out expanded polystyrene packaging is failing and was never possible, industry says Read more “As an industry, we are 100% committed to making a safe product,” she said. “What we didn’t want was to put a valuable product into landfill.” She said more needed to be done to correctly classify waste at its source to ensure only materials that could be safely recycled made their way to recycling facilities. The EPA’s spokesperson said the regulator was “committed to protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health while driving a circular economy”. “The use of good quality clean soil excavated from construction activities is a great example of a circular economy that reuses waste resources efficiently and productively.” They said in October last year the regulator had commenced another “campaign to assess compliance with the resource recovery order, including site inspections and collecting samples for testing”.

Through a statement read to the court, one of his seven victims said Cappo shared a video she sent to him in confidence — which was spread around a school. ""I have been bullied and harassed… I have been called a sl** to my face,"" she wrote. ""People would say hurtful things about my body and threaten me with physical harm as they walk past me. ""Only a few people from my friendship circle still speak with me as people did not want to be seen with me."" The impact statements of three teenage victims were read out in court. ( ABC News: Che Chorley ) Another victim said she felt sickened to hear she was not the only victim. ""He thinks he can wave money in front of 15 to 16-year-old girls' faces and get what he wants  — I fell for that and was taken advantage of,"" she wrote. ""At first I only thought it was me and my friend, but when I found out it was a lot of girls in Adelaide, it made me feel grossed out."" A third victim told the court the incident had caused a lot of shame. ""It is so easy for these things to happen behind your back,"" she wrote. ""He promised me that he wouldn't leak it and he did. ""I am embarrassed knowing that those kinds of photos are out there, and there is nothing I can do about it."" Cappo would face 'issues' in jail, court hears The court heard evidence from Cappo's treating psychologist Paul Kassapidis who said Cappo had learning difficulties, generalised anxiety and was socially withdrawn. Mr Kassapidis warned Cappo would be adversely impacted if he were jailed due to his social naivety. ""He's not streetwise enough to be careful with the information he lets out so he's quite likely to be quite blunt with what he's charged with and then that creates other issues,"" Mr Kassapidis said. Under cross-examination, the prosecution asked Mr Kassapidis about Cappo's social media addiction. ""Mr Cappo strikes me as a young man who has spent more time in front of the computer than anything else,"" he said. The court heard Cappo had seen more than 500,000 pornographic images. Cappo's lawyer Andrew Moffa asked Judge Michelle Sutcliffe for a suspended sentence given his young age at the time of the offending. Cappo is a family member of the Cappo Seafoods company, a well-known South Australian seafood business. There is no suggestion the company or any Cappo family members are implicated in the offending. The matter returns to court next week.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/29/asbestos-nsw-findings-watchdog-epa-contaminated-soil-childcare-centres-schools-parks,"The New South Wales environmental regulator has known for more than a decade that producers of soil fill made from construction and demolition waste were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community.  Internal documents from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), obtained by Guardian Australia, warned widespread breaches by industry meant potentially contaminated product might have been applied to land across the state, including at childcare centres, residential areas, schools and parks.  But the regulator walked away from a proposal to tighten regulations in 2022 after it received pushback from the waste industry warning the policy changes would force up the cost of landfill disposal, drive more waste into landfill and force skip bin companies out of business.  Soil fill could contain asbestos fibres  The potentially contaminated product, known as “recovered fines”, is a soil or sand substitute made from the processing of construction and demolition waste, including skip bin residue, after all large recyclable material has been removed.  It is a different product from the contaminated mulch recently found in Rozelle parklands. But experts say that unlike the bonded asbestos found in Rozelle, which is relatively harmless unless broken apart, recovered fines could contain asbestos fibres, which pose a greater risk to human health.  “Fibrous asbestos poses risk [because] inhalation can take it into your lungs and the fibres then get stuck in the lungs. It doesn’t go away,” said Prof Ravi Naidu, an internationally recognised expert in soil pollution from the University of Newcastle.  Waste facilities in NSW produce about 700,000 tonnes of recovered fines each year for application on land including landscaping, sporting fields and residential developments, according to the EPA. The product is not allowed to be used on agricultural land or around water infrastructure.  View image in fullscreen NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP  “The community will be rightly outraged that the profitability of industry appears to have been put above community safety by the EPA,” said the NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty, whose seat of Balmain takes in the Rozelle parklands where bonded asbestos was discovered in mulch.  “If you look at the evidence, it’s pretty compelling that there’s a large problem.”  Widespread breaches  Documents released through government information public access laws as part of a Guardian Australia investigation show two enforcement investigations by the regulator – one in 2013 and one in 2019 – found widespread breaches by waste facilities of regulations that require producers of recovered fines to make sure their product is safe for reuse in the community.  Under NSW resource recovery regulations, producers of the processed waste must ensure their product does not exceed limits on contaminants such as lead, cadmium, plastics and glass.  There is no requirement they test specifically for asbestos.  View image in fullscreen Asbestos was found in mulch surrounding a playground at Rozelle parklands. Photograph: Peter Hannam  The detailed results of the EPA’s investigations have not been released previously and include a finding in 2013 that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations.  In a follow-up investigation in 2019, the EPA reviewed about 50,000 pieces of testing and sampling data from 21 waste facilities and found 71% had exceeded the absolute maximum concentration limit for a chemical or physical contaminant at least once over a two-year period, with the most frequent breaches identified for metals, glass and rigid plastics, pH levels and lead.  More than half of samples contained asbestos  The NSW regulations for recovered fines do not require facilities to test for asbestos and the 2019 review found only 29% of facilities had requested asbestos testing.  In a second stage of that investigation, the EPA took its own samples at 14 facilities. That round of testing, according to an EPA industry presentation, found 57% of facilities had asbestos in their recovered fines.  Some of the EPA’s findings from its 2019 investigation relating to poor industry compliance, including the asbestos contamination, were made public by the regulator in 2022 when it proposed a series of reforms.  The documents show that between 2013 and 2022, the EPA gave extensive consideration to tightening regulations based on the findings of its enforcement campaigns.  One preliminary analysis of potential options highlighted the potential risks of a business-as-usual approach by pointing to the 2013 finding that 94% of industry had not complied with at least one aspect of the regulations.  “This means that up to 658,000 tonnes (94% of 700,000 tonnes) of material produced annually may not have complied with the order,” the document states.  “This non-compliant material may be applied on sensitive land uses such as residential, child care facilities, schools and parks.”  Children at risk  A spokesperson for the EPA told Guardian Australia the human health and environmental risks associated with recovered fines were low because the products were “generally used in low-contact situations, such as engineering fill and pipe bedding”.  The community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm. Prof Mark Taylor  But Mark Taylor, an honorary professor at Macquarie University who specialises in environmental contamination, said “the ultimate end use of recovered soils and fines is unknown”.  He said the products “could end up being used in the most sensitive environments involving young children under the age of five”.  Small children have a lower body mass index and are more likely to put things in their mouth so pollutants pose a greater risk to their health, experts say.  “If you’re going to have unfettered use of these products, you need to have the most conservative standards applied to the materials in order to protect human health where the risk is greatest,” Taylor said.  “To not do so means the industry is complicit and wilfully contaminating the environment.”  View image in fullscreen Signs and barricades at Rozelle parklands on 10 January. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP  Taylor acknowledged the recovery and processing of waste for new uses was a “herculean task”, but said the public needed to know that products were safe and fit for purpose.  “While it is critical that resources are reused and recycled wherever possible to assist in meeting sustainable outcomes, the community needs to be placed first to protect them from unnecessary risks of harm.”  Proposed changes  According to the documents obtained by Guardian Australia, the EPA considered a tough approach that involved revoking the existing regulations for recovered fines and introducing site-specific ones, which would have meant the material could not be applied to land as a soil or sand substitute or for landscaping purposes unless a facility demonstrated its recovered fines were high quality.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another option, later put to industry, was tougher “batch” regulations that would require facilities to receive the results from sampling and testing before products went out to third parties.  The EPA also considered introducing rules for asbestos testing and discussed limiting the application of soil fill products derived from recovered fines to construction works “at depth”, prohibiting their use in landscaping.  The management of asbestos in recovered fines remains under review by the state’s chief scientist.  The EPA put its proposal to industry in late 2021 that it intended to revoke the general orders and exemptions that allowed broad use of recovered fines on land in favour of new rules that would allow for their use where high-quality product could be demonstrated.  But this was abandoned in 2022 after significant industry objections and negative media coverage.  Pressure from industry  According to the NSW government, industry raised “significant concerns” with the proposed changes, including that they would be challenging to comply with and could impose significant costs that would be passed on to skip bin customers, as well as reduce recycling and recovery rates and increase illegal dumping.  One letter from multiple skip bin companies, released to Guardian Australia, said negative impacts would include a substantial increase in landfill fees, construction cost increases, flow-on effects for landscapers, small renovators and “everyday mums and dads”, and “most small rubbish removal and skip bin businesses will be forced to close leaving Bingo to monopolise the industry”.  In an email in May 2022, the EPA’s acting chief executive Jacqueleine Moore told stakeholders that the regulator had “heard the concerns of the waste and resource recovery industry, small businesses, and the construction industry”.  “Following this consultation, the EPA will not move ahead with the proposed changes to the rules governing how recovered fines are managed and recycled,” the email said.  “The existing recovered fines orders and exemptions will remain in place. The EPA will instead focus on waste industry education, monitoring and compliance to improve environmental outcomes.”  I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty  A former employee of the EPA, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said: “A lot of people within the EPA who worked on this policy were actually really angry that we backflipped.  “They felt really let down because they had done all of this work, there had been a lot of policy work, science work, that had been done over a long period of time and they had a lot of evidence.”  Shetty said the backdown was “a clear case of regulatory failure”. “I think the inaction from the EPA is damning. There’s clearly a problem here,” she said.  Part of a ‘circular economy’  The construction and demolition industry generates more than 12m tonnes of waste annually in NSW, which makes up more than half of all waste generated in the state. Recovered fines account for approximately 3% of NSW’s annual waste, according to the EPA’s spokesperson, and about half of the estimated 700,000 tonnes generated each year “is clean, uncontaminated soil”.  In their feedback to the EPA the peak industry bodies the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association (WMRR) and the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association said they were “categorically opposed” to the EPA’s proposal to revoke the regulations covering recovered fines “given the important role that it plays in ensuring construction material is circulated within the NSW economy and environment, and in doing so, reduces the reliance on virgin material while creating jobs and investment in NSW”.  They described the findings in the EPA’s 2019 investigation as “flawed” because they were made before construction facility guidelines were introduced that had improved facility practices and the “quality and consistency of this material”.  They said the impacts on people or the environment of foreign materials in recovered fines were “likely to be extremely limited given that these materials are already widely present in the environment”.  Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of WMRR, said recovered fines were often used as a base for roads and other construction projects and were capped by other materials. She said industry wanted the regulator to take an approach to contaminants that matched the products’ intended use.  “As an industry, we are 100% committed to making a safe product,” she said. “What we didn’t want was to put a valuable product into landfill.”  She said more needed to be done to correctly classify waste at its source to ensure only materials that could be safely recycled made their way to recycling facilities.  The EPA’s spokesperson said the regulator was “committed to protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health while driving a circular economy”.  “The use of good quality clean soil excavated from construction activities is a great example of a circular economy that reuses waste resources efficiently and productively.”  They said in October last year the regulator had commenced another “campaign to assess compliance with the resource recovery order, including site inspections and collecting samples for testing”.  The compliance campaign would be completed by the end of April this year and would “inform further regulatory action, and reform of the resource recovery framework” in line with recommendations from a 2021 independent review by Dr Cathy Wilkinson.  “Our work will be further guided later this year by a NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer report commissioned to provide advice on the management of asbestos in recovered fines, and CSIRO/EPA research currently underway on microplastics, chemically treated timbers and synthetic mineral fibres,” the spokesperson said.  These reports are expected later in 2024.","NSW watchdog failed to act on contamination risk despite ‘damning’ asbestos findings | New South Wales | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 4 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Environment Climate crisis Wildlife Energy Pollution Contaminants such as asbestos and lead have been found in soil samples tested by the EPA.

Weekly rents have soared as compared to the past year as low supply and strong demand impact the housing market.      The latest report from property research firm PropTrack report shows the total number of listings on realestate.com.au in December 2023 fell to a record low of 30.2 per cent below the decade average for the month.      Meanwhile, new listings reached a historic low, down 4.6 per cent in December year-on-year and 20.7 per cent lower than the decade average.      And rental vacancies have remained near record lows at 1.1 per cent, down from 1.3 per cent in December 2022.      However, the number of inquiries per listing rose by 3.3 per cent over 2023, hiking the median advertised price to $580 a week.    PropTrack economic research director Cameron Kusher maintains there will be no meaningful change to the market without additional housing, particularly in capital cities where there is a ""critical need"" for more dwellings.      ""Serious consideration needs to be given to the financing of these projects and the capacity to build the volume of housing we need,"" Kusher said.      There's been a countrywide trend of investors selling off their investment properties due to unaffordable mortgage repayments, and while there has been a rebound in this trend, it is not enough to replenish depleted levels of housing stock, according to the PropTrack report.      Rents are expected to continue to increase and renters were still likely to face challenging conditions, Kusher said. But he added the intensity of the increases is likely to ease.      In Australia's capitals, annual rent growth slowed from 17.8 per cent in 2022 to 13.2 per cent in 2023, while slowing from 11.6 per cent to 4.2 per cent in the regions.      ""While we expect rents to continue to rise this year, it's likely the rate of growth will slow,"" Kusher said.      ""The already higher cost of renting and overall increase in the cost of living will limit rent price increases moving forward.""    Across Australia, almost half of all suburbs are classified as being in extreme pain based on rental stress, according to a new report. Source: AAP / Sam Mooy Single Australians, in particular, are bearing the brunt of the rental crisis according to a report from Victoria's peak body for community housing.      Community Housing Industry Association (CHIA) Victoria has revealed 85 per cent of new applications to the state's social housing waitlist are from single-person households but less than a third of public housing is one-bedroom.      Sarah Toohey, chief executive of CHIA Victoria, says raising the rate of JobSeeker to $78 per day would help fund much-needed housing.      ""Social housing is a lifeline for singles - it delivers affordable rent, at no more than 30 per cent of income,"" Toohey said.      “However, because JobSeeker is so low, 30 per cent of a single person's income makes it challenging to cover the cost of building and maintaining homes.

The latest data from PropTrack shows rental properties are becoming harder to find as listings hit historic lows.  PropTrack's Rental Report for December shows new rental listings last month were 4.6% lower than the year before, while total rental listings also hit a record low of 4.7% annually.  ""It's still an extremely challenging rental market with very low volumes of stock,"" PropTrack's economic research director, Cameron Kusher, told AM.  ""Of course, we've got strong population growth, which is putting more competition for the rental market, and we're seeing a higher level of demand for rental properties.  ""So unfortunately, for those that are looking to rent, it's still a very tough slog out there in the market.""  Although the data shows the pace of rent increases is starting to taper off (it only increased by 11.5% in 2023, compared to 15.6% in 2022), there is little relief on the horizon for renters.  While it's hard to determine from the data, Mr Kusher has told AM he suspects some renters are choosing to cop the rental increase they receive, instead of shopping around to find a new place to live that may not be any cheaper.  ""It's hard to sort of see that in any of the data but I have a strong suspicion that that is happening,"" he said.  ""I think if people have a rental, they're more inclined to stay there as long as they are in a position to be able to do that because everyone's seen on social media and and those sorts of things how many people are turning up for these rental inspections.  ""So I think there is generally a strong preference to stay where you are unless the landlord is being completely unreasonable with how much they're asking for those rent increases.""

(That's how I'd sum up the Australian share market's performance today.) The ASX 200 almost hit a record high this morning, before much of the excitement fizzled out. It climbed as high as 7,631 points (just two points shy of its highest level ever). But in the end, the benchmark index rose 0.3%, to finish at 7,600 points (with industrials, tech and real estate being the top-performing sectors). Regardless, the share market has been on a very optimistic streak — having risen for its seventh straight day. (In case you're wondering, the ASX 200 hit a record high of 7,633 points on 13 August, 2021). Now here are the best and worst performing stocks: Tech and mining stocks posted the largest gains. (Refinitiv) Shares of Brisbane-based Megaport jumped 27.6%, making it today's biggest winner. This was after the cloud network service provider reported financial results which beat market estimates. Megaport revealed its second-quarter operating earnings were $15.1 million (compared with a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of $11.3 million, according to Citi). Meanwhile, shares of Nickel Industries jumped 20.8%, after the company increased its dividend and announced a share buyback (valued at up to $151 million). Many of today's best performing stocks were mining stocks. On the flip side, the companies posting the heaviest losses were retailers JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group, along with financial stocks AMP, QBE Insurance, Suncorp and Netwealth Group.

Long before he helped spark a revolution in the future of automobiles, he foresaw the need for payment security in a digital world and earned his first fortune as a co-founder of PayPal. Along the way, he has explored the outer reaches of space, controversially taken control of one of the world's biggest social media sites and experimented with the idea of, not just Artificial Intelligence (AI), but linking human brains to computers. Right now, however, legions of investors are concerned about Musk's increasingly erratic behaviour while his competitors are fearful they may end up following the path he is treading.

This was after a Hong Kong court ordered the debt-ridden company to be liquidated on Monday, as it was unable to reach a restructuring deal with its offshore lenders. News of the verdict caused Evergrande's share price to plunge by more than 20%, before the trading suspension was imposed. At its peak, Evergrande was China's second largest property development firm, worth around $80 billion. Now it's worth around $400 million, and its share price slumped by 99% in the past five years.

Founded in 1931, the company employs more than 600 staff in Australia and New Zealand (across 141 stores). It also has 28 stores run by franchisees. PwC has been appointed as the company's administrator in both countries. Godfreys will continue to operate its business, while undertaking an ""immediate operational restructure"" and sale process. Godfreys expects to shut down 54 stores in the next fortnight. As a result, 171 staff in Australia are expected to lose their jobs, while 22 in New Zealand will be sacked. The first creditors' meeting will be held on February 9. If the Godfreys brand name sounds vaguely familiar, you may remember some of their colourful TV ads (which showed their vacuum cleaners sucking up a bowling ball): ""Like many retailers, Godfreys has faced a challenging economic and operating environment,"" said Craig Crosbie, the lead administrator from PwC Australia. ""Lower customer demand amid cost of living pressures, higher operating costs, and increased competition have all taken a toll on profitability, with some stores more impacted than others. “Our aim is to move quickly to restructure Godfreys to preserve as much of the business and as many jobs as possible. Godfreys director Mr Grant Hancock said it was a difficult decision to enter into administration. He said it was made with the best interests of Godfreys’ employees, customers and broader stakeholders in mind. Share Copy Did COVID ruin Christmas for hospitality? M 21h ago Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 7:13am By Michael Janda As noted in previous posts, December's big falls for household goods, department store and clothing sales were broadly expected, given November's Black Friday spending spree. What has caught a lot of analysts by surprise was the notable 1.1% slump in seasonally adjusted turnover at cafes, restaurants and takeaway outlets . While we've changed our retail spending habits, surely we're not all suddenly throwing our end of year/summer parties in November instead of December? One interpretation is that this reflects households tightening their belts in response to the rising cost of living , especially amid rising mortgage rates and tax bills. I think it's hard to argue against a lot of that going on, given the very low levels of consumer confidence and the recent trends in this sector — CBA's Stephen Wu points out that it's the fourth consecutive monthly decline for eating out, to now be 5.7% below its September 2023 peak . But one other factor may have been a COVID case spike in December , which could have kept a lot of people at home — it kept me and my immediate family stuck at home on Christmas Day :( This ABC story looked at the spike in cases and, as it noted, this is likely understated given that most people just do a RAT at home now (if they even bother doing that) rather than testing at a clinic and being recorded in the official data. These three charts show the latest COVID-19 numbers from around Australia Share Copy Key Event Retail sales post biggest monthly slump outside of COVID, GST introduction M 22h ago Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 6:35am By Michael Janda While there's a lot of seasonal adjustment shenanigans going on due to the increasing popularity of Black Friday sales in November, December's retail slump is almost unprecedented. So, retail sales bounced 1.6% in November before plunging 2.7% in December . That drop in December is the worst seasonally adjusted monthly result in the four-decade history of the retail sales data outside of two months in 2020 (COVID) and July 2000 (the introduction of the GST , when many prices went up 10% literally overnight). Even if you deduct the November bounce from the December fall (to try and account for the shift forward in spending habits) a 1.1% fall would be the equal 21st worst in more than 500 months of retail sales data. Whichever way you cut it, these are recessionary numbers, which Capital Economics analyst Abhijit Surya says will weigh massively on economic growth, as measured by GDP. ""As a result of the weak December result, sales values rose by just 0.5% across Q4,"" he noted. ""Therefore, even if retail price gains moderated slightly, we believe that sales volumes will have contracted anew last quarter . If we're right, real goods consumption will almost certainly have seen another leg down in Q4."" With household consumption well over half the economy, that raises the real risk of a negative quarter of GDP … and therefore increases the spectre of a technical recession. Australia's strong population growth plus the level of inflation over the past year makes annual retail sales growth of just 0.8% absolutely abyssmal. Mr Surya says only food retailing escaped a monthly decline in December (+0.1%), with a 1.1% drop in spending at cafes, restaurants and takeaways not affected by Black Friday sales and suggesting customers may be reining in spending more broadly. ""The upshot is that the Australian consumer is on much shakier ground than the RBA had anticipated,"" he argued. ""Accordingly, we're sticking with our view that the Bank will start cutting rates by May , rather than in September as most analysts are predicting."" Share Copy Key Event Christmas and Boxing Day sales fall as consumers cut back on discretionary spending D 22h ago Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 5:49am By David Chau Last month's Christmas and Boxing Day sales were worse-than-expected for Australian retailers. Consumers spent $35.19 billion at the shops in December, seasonally adjusted, according to the latest data from the ABS. While that's a large sum of money, it's also a 2.7% drop (compared to the previous month). (Economists were expecting a milder 1% drop in retail turnover). Christmas and Boxing Day sales disappointed in 2023. (ABS) It follows a 1.6% increase in November, seasonally adjusted, which received a massive boost from the increasingly popular Black Friday sales. ""The large fall in retail turnover in December was caused by a fall in discretionary spending,"" said Ben Dorber, head of retail statistics at the ABS. ""Consumers brought forward some of their usual December spending to November to take advantage of Black Friday sales. “This shift in spending from December to November reflects the growing popularity of Black Friday sales and the impact of cost-of-living pressures, with consumers seeking out bargains and taking advantage of discounts in November."" Share Copy Key Event Former Boeing employees warn production defects ignored by company and US aviation regulator put passengers at risk D 22h ago Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 5:43am By David Chau Whistleblowers are warning production defects on Boeing planes haven't been addressed by the company or the US regulator, putting travellers at greater risk of being involved in an incident. The aircraft maker has faced increased scrutiny in recent weeks after its most commercially popular but scandal-plagued plane (the 737 Max) was involved in another mid-air emergency when a hole blew open in the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 Alaskan Airlines flight earlier this month. The ABC has spoken to former Boeing and FAA workers who allege they raised safety concerns with the company and the watchdog but they were ignored. The whistleblowers' interviews paint a picture of a company culture that prioritises production speed over quality and safety, leading to defects being missed or ignored to meet deadlines. For more, here's the exclusive story by Nadia Daly : 'That plane shouldn't have been built': Former Boeing workers slam speed over safety culture Share Copy Key Event Consumers feeling deeply pessimistic over high inflation and interest rates: ANZ - Roy Morgan D 23h ago Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 5:31am By David Chau Hello there! I'm jumping in to help Kate with today's blog. Here's an interesting chart which shows consumers are feeling deeply pessimistic these days (almost as if they were living through a recession): Consumer confidence fell to 82.5 points, according to ANZ and Roy Morgan, which surveyed 1,511 consumers last week. (It's down 1.9 points compared to the previous week). That's a score that's typically seen during an economic downturn (eg. the COVID recession, and the global financial crisis in 2008). Any score below 100 points means the pessimists outweigh the optimists. In short, it's not good for business if consumers are feeling gloomy and cutting back on spending (especially on discretionary items) due to higher interest rates and cost-of-living pressures.

""If US‑Iran tensions escalate, particularly through a direct confrontation, the risk rises that Iran's oil supply is adversely impacted,"" the bank's commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said. ""[Iran's] oil exports are likely the most vulnerable via potentially greater enforcement of sanctions. "" How Iran responds to rising US tensions will also dictate the course for oil markets . The key concern is Iran threatening a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, which sees the transit of 15‑20% of global oil supply."" Mr Dhar notes that the recent rise in oil prices ""mostly reflects the higher risks"" of Iran being caught up in the wider conflict in the Middle East, especially after a tanker carrying Russian fuel was attacked over the weekend. ""Despite the escalation in attacks in the Red Sea and the 6.5‑7% of global oil and fuel supply that transits through the waterway, oil supply still remains largely unaffected given tankers can re‑route between Asia and Europe around Africa ,"" he said. ""The Red Sea and Suez Canal has become an increasingly important sea route for Russian oil and refined products to Asia due to western sanctions following the Ukraine war. ""The route around Africa takes around an additional two weeks compared to the Suez Canal and Red Sea, thereby incurring additional labour and fuel costs. ""In our view, these two options surmise the main impact of the Red Sea disruption — an increase in transport costs between Europe and Asia. ""Oil prices though should remain fairly resilient to the Red Sea disruption given oil supply is still flowing."" Share Copy Key Event Data shows rental properties are even harder to find as listings hit fresh lows K Yesterday, 3:05am Tue 30 Jan 2024 at 3:05am By Kate Ainsworth If you're a renter, I have some grim news to share (although, it might not come as a shock). The latest data from PropTrack shows rental properties are becoming harder to find as listings hit historic lows . PropTrack's Rental Report for December shows new rental listings last month were 4.6% lower than the year before, while total rental listings also hit a record low of 4.7% annually. ""It's still an extremely challenging rental market with very low volumes of stock,"" PropTrack's economic research director, Cameron Kusher, told AM. ""Of course , we've got strong population growth , which is putting more competition for the rental market, and we're seeing a higher level of demand for rental properties . "" So unfortunately, for those that are looking to rent, it's still a very tough slog out there in the market ."" Although the data shows the pace of rent increases is starting to taper off (it only increased by 11.5% in 2023, compared to 15.6% in 2022), there is little relief on the horizon for renters. While it's hard to determine from the data, Mr Kusher has told AM he suspects some renters are choosing to cop the rental increase they receive , instead of shopping around to find a new place to live that may not be any cheaper. ""It's hard to sort of see that in any of the data but I have a strong suspicion that that is happening,"" he said. ""I think if people have a rental, they're more inclined to stay there as long as they are in a position to be able to do that because everyone's seen on social media and and those sorts of things how many people are turning up for these rental inspections. ""So I think there is generally a strong preference to stay where you are unless the landlord is being completely unreasonable with how much they're asking for those rent increases.""

2,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/30/qld-weather-floods-queensland-brisbane-heavy-rain-flooding-seq-severe-storms,"A relentless series of storms is starting to take an emotional toll on people in Queensland’s south-east as the Bureau of Meteorology warns of more heavy rain to come.  Roads are cut off, more than 20 schools are closed and a town is flooded after heavy rainfall inundated the region, sparking multiple rescues.  The BoM warned of potentially life-threatening flash flooding due to the deluge.  “We could expect to see these heavy rainfalls and the potentially intense rainfall that could lead to further dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding in the coming hours, through the remainder of today and into tomorrow,” a bureau spokesperson said on Tuesday.  Samford Valley was one of the worst hit, receiving 300mm in three hours, while 126mm fell in two hours at Upper Caboolture.  Swiftwater crews rescued 13 people as flood waters rose across the Moreton Bay, Somerset, Lockyer Valley and Darling Downs regions overnight.  View image in fullscreen The Moreton Bay region saw eight rescues as flood waters rose overnight. Photograph: QAS  Eight of those rescues were in the Moreton Bay region alone, with the SES also receiving 28 calls for help in the area overnight.  The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, warned Moreton Bay residents that conditions may not improve soon.  “Our message, particularly if you’re in Moreton Bay, is please take care; and certainly if the road is flooded, forget it,” he said.  The town of Laidley, west of Brisbane, is already flooded after the creek broke its banks. An evacuation centre was opened at the Laidley State high school for those seeking shelter.  Flood warnings are current for large parts of central Queensland as well as the south-east.  View image in fullscreen Bray Park, north of Brisbane, was one of a number of south-east Queensland areas hit by heavy storms overnight. Photograph: QAS  Flood watches have been issued for parts of western Queensland as well as much of the central and southeast areas of the state plus northeast NSW.  The Scenic Rim mayor, Greg Christensen, said the latest round of storms were not providing any comfort for residents trying to recover from wild weather that devastated the region over the Christmas period.  “Every time we get these intense falls now, there are people who are still very traumatised, and we understand this is actually quite difficult for some of them,” he said.  The residents’ concerns have not been helped by landslips and fallen trees that have occurred over the past few days as more rain and storms roll through.  “Everything’s just so unstable; with more rain on sodden ground, things that were destabilised have finally let go,” Christensen said.  Clean-up efforts have been stymied with the heavy onset of rain and nine roads have been closed due to flooding, cutting access for recovery crews.  With more rain predicted throughout Tuesday, Christensen said one of his main concerns was fatigue.  “We’re all trying to find a way to recover,” he said.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ex-Tropical Cyclone Kirrily is also ensuring more wet weather in Queensland’s north-west, days after crossing the coast.  The area south of Cloncurry has been one of the worst hit out west with Seymour Gap receiving 256mm in 24 hours, while 244mm fell at Kirby.  Farther south at Winton, all rural roads are cut with some properties expected to be isolated for six to eight weeks due to flood waters.  West of Winton towards Boulia, the Middleton community has recorded about 450mm since the weekend.  “The Boulia road through to Alice Springs has currently got three metres of water over the crossings,” the Winton mayor, Gavin Baskett, said.  “Some of the crossings are at the highest [flood levels] some graziers have ever seen them.”  View image in fullscreen Flooded roads are seen near the South Pine River in Strathpine, north of Brisbane on Tuesday. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP  Winton’s local disaster management group has been activated with some properties bunkering down for a long, isolated period in flood waters.  “They are all graziers out there; lucky it isn’t tourist season,” Baskett said.  The BoM said the ex-tropical cyclone was expected to linger between Mount Isa and Longreach for the next few days.  Crews are still working to restore electricity for north Queenslanders left without power after Kirrily crossed the coast three days ago.  About 66,000 customers lost power at the peak of the wild weather. The remaining 1,000 homes still without electricity were expected to be restored by Tuesday night.  Kirrily struck barely a month after Tropical Cyclone Jasper caused record flooding that devastated the far north.","Storms leave some Queensland residents ‘traumatised’ amid warnings of more heavy rain | Queensland | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 3 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development More Intense rainfall brings flash flooding to south-east Queensland – video Queensland Storms leave some Queensland residents ‘traumatised’ amid warnings of more heavy rain Roads are cut off, more than 20 schools closed and a town flooded after heavy rainfall inundated south-east Queensland, sparking multiple rescues Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast Australian Associated Press Tue 30 Jan 2024 07.19 GMT First published on Tue 30 Jan 2024 00.01 GMT A relentless series of storms is starting to take an emotional toll on people in Queensland’s south-east as the Bureau of Meteorology warns of more heavy rain to come.

(9News)  From the 9News helicopter the scale of the crisis was painfully clear, the town in the Moreton Bay region resembling a series of small islands as backyards were turned into lakes and moats surrounded homes.  The scenes were eerily similar to the south-east's floods of 2022 and 2011.  Residents at one home were seen peering out from their second-storey balcony at waterfront views that weren't there yesterday, their neighbours escaping their homes with camping chairs, trudging through knee-deep water.  Roads leading underwater, football fields well beyond water logged, and people resorting to kayaks to make their way down submerged streets.  Clean up begins  At Bray Park piles of belongings have already begun appearing on footpaths as people face the painful task of throwing away anything destroyed by flooding.  ""People have had these [belongings] for decades, what happens now, they become trash,"" 9News reporter Peter Fegan said from a street at Bray Park.

(9News) From the 9News helicopter the scale of the crisis was painfully clear, the town in the Moreton Bay region resembling a series of small islands as backyards were turned into lakes and moats surrounded homes. The scenes were eerily similar to the south-east's floods of 2022 and 2011. Residents at one home were seen peering out from their second-storey balcony at waterfront views that weren't there yesterday, their neighbours escaping their homes with camping chairs, trudging through knee-deep water. Roads leading underwater, football fields well beyond water logged, and people resorting to kayaks to make their way down submerged streets.

A mining equipment company says it will pay for the repatriation of a Canadian employee who died in Western Australia's remote Pilbara region last week.  Ambrose Walton was employed as a diesel mechanic with Schlam Group, a multinational company contracting at several mines across the region.  His body was found on Thursday, along with the Schlam vehicle he had been driving before he crashed on an unsealed road, about 90 kilometres from Karratha.  The company says it will pay the costs to repatriate his remains to Canada, after family members started an online fundraiser to bring him home.  Schlam Group chief executive David Haslett said the company was working with the family to return Ambrose Walton and his belongings from Perth.

""We have been overwhelmed with everyone's generosity. It truly brings us to tears,"" she wrote.  ""We can't thank you enough.""  Ms Walton also thanked the support given by Schlam, local police, and Mr Walton's friends in the Pilbara.

The federal opposition has suggested the government is failing to live up to the standards it applied before being elected after revelations that Papua New Guinea is negotiating police cooperation with China. Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham highlighted Labor's criticism of the Coalition after Solomon Islands and China signed a security pact just before the 2022 federal election.  Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham highlighted Labor's criticism of the Coalition after Solomon Islands and China signed a security pact just before the 2022 federal election. What's next? PNG's Prime Minister James Marape will visit Canberra next week to address federal parliament.  The Coalition is trying to ramp up pressure on the federal government over new police cooperation negotiations between China and Papua New Guinea, saying it's ""essential"" that Australia's strategic position in the Pacific nation isn't undermined.  The Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea Justin Tkatchenko on Monday told Reuters that China's government approached PNG in September last year and had ""offered to assist our policing and security on the internal security side"".  But it's not yet clear whether China is pursuing a formal security pact similar to the one it signed with Solomon Islands in 2022, provoking deep consternation in Canberra and Washington.  Mr Tkatchenko stressed discussions with China were in their ""early stage"" and that PNG had not yet accepted the offer for help, saying his country had to make sure it would not duplicate assistance already provided by the United States and Australia.  But the Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham pointed to Labor's furious criticisms of the Coalition after Solomon Islands and China signed their security pact just before the 2022 federal election, which then shadow foreign minister Penny Wong labelled ""the worst failure of Australian foreign policy in the Pacific since the end of World War Two"".  Senator Wong also pointed out at the time that China now had a security agreement with ""a nation that's just over 1,600 kilometres from Cairns"".  ""It is up to Penny Wong to live up to the standards she applied to others pre-election, such as her claims that the Solomon Islands security pact could have been stopped,"" Senator Birmingham said.  ""Or is this another case of Labor saying one thing pre-election but doing another post-election?  ""PNG is just 150km from Australia and, whilst respecting their sovereignty, it is both logical and essential that Australia remains PNG's security partner of choice.""  Mr Tkatchenko played down the significance of the talks on Tuesday, telling The Australian that PNG would ""stick with our traditional partners"" on security cooperation.  He also issued a lengthy statement emphasising the importance of the major security pact that PNG signed with Australia last year and calling Australia his country’s ""closest neighbour and a traditional security partner"".  Pacific Minister Pat Conroy told the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that Mr Tkatchenko had been ""very clear that Papua New Guinea was sticking with Australia"", and that while other countries could ""make offers"" to PNG, Australia was confident in its position.  The controversy comes ahead of PNG Prime Minister James Marape visiting Canberra next week, where he'll make a historic address to Australia's parliament.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not say whether he would raise the nascent security talks with Mr Marape during his visit to Canberra.  ""PNG of course is a sovereign government and it's a sovereign government that has no closer friend than Australia,"" he said.  ""We are the security partner of choice for PNG as we are for most of the countries in the Pacific.""  Justin Tkachenko has stressed discussions with China were in their ""early stage"" and PNG had not yet accepted the offer for help. ( ABC News: Natalie Whiting )  Both Mr Marape and Mr Tkatchenko have stressed that they see Australia as PNG's main security ally and view China primarily as a critical economic partner.  Mr Albanese also stressed that Australia had ""recently provided support for PNG on issues such as police training"" and said he was ""in regular contact with the prime minister"".  One Australian government source told the ABC that while it was unlikely that Mr Marape's government would accept China's offer, the latest approach showed Beijing was still working ""relentlessly"" to embed itself as a policing and security player in the Pacific.  Papua New Guinea's former prime minister and prominent opposition figure, Peter O'Neill, also issued a statement on Tuesday lashing the negotiations.  ""I am deeply concerned to read Papua New Guinea's minister foreign affairs is actively discussing our country's internal, domestic police and security arrangements with China,"" he said.  ""China is our largest trading partner and an important international friend to our country.

""China does not have any jurisdiction over Taiwan. We have a president that is democratically elected,"" Mr Wu said in an exclusive interview with 7.30.  ""They are telling us that the election here in Taiwan is between peace and war and if we elect the wrong leader … it will mean war.  ""This is an exercise of democracy. But China doesn't accept that because China is an authoritarian country.""  William Lai was elected as Taiwan president earlier this month. ( AP Photo: Louise Delmotte )  On January 13, Taiwanese voters rewarded the ruling DPP party with a third term, electing the 64-year-old Lai as president.  ""Democracy should not be decided by an authoritarian regime, no matter how strongly they feel about the election … It's about the people here,"" Mr Wu told 7.30.  In the lead-up to the vote, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement reiterating Beijing's opposition to ""Taiwan independence"", attacking the ruling DPP party which Beijing accuses of championing the cause of separatism.  But Mr Wu says the president-elect is a ""moderate"" who ""would like to maintain the status quo"".  Pacific countries 'a target' of China's diplomacy  Nauru was one of only a handful of nations that recognised Taiwan's independent statehood. ( AP: Jason Oxenham/pool photo )  Just days after Taiwan's presidential elections, the Pacific Island nation of Nauru announced it was severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China.  Mr Wu says Nauru was an ""easy target"".  ""The Chinese government is always using economic enticement to secure diplomatic recognition of our diplomatic allies. And in the case of Nauru, I think the Chinese government is using that,"" he said.  Asked whether ""economic enticement"" was also directed at individuals, Mr Wu said they didn't have evidence of that occurring in Nauru but claimed it had happened elsewhere.  ""That is usually what we see. The Chinese are engaging in something that we call 'elite capturing'. They try to bribe political elites to secure diplomatic recognition,"" he said.  Mr Wu has accused China of inflaming tensions with threats of military intervention. ( Reuters: Noel Celis/Pool )  Twelve countries around the world formally recognise Taiwan and this week, attention turned to Tuvalu, the Pacific nation where the pro-Taiwan prime minister has just lost his seat.  But Mr Wu believes Tuvalu won't follow into Nauru's footsteps.  ""I think the relations are quite solid,"" he said. ""At this moment, even though they just went through their national election, I believe that next prime minister, or their next candidate, will still be loyal to the relations with Taiwan.""  The foreign minister says the decision by Nauru is part of a pattern.  ""China has been trying to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. They are trying to squeeze Taiwan out of the international organisations. They try to snatch our diplomatic ties,"" he said.  ""They try to pressure other countries to reduce their contacts and communication and friendship with Taiwan. But the world does not operate that way.""  Australia and Taiwan  Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (centre right) meets with an Australian delegation visiting Taipei in September 2023. ( Supplied: Taiwan Presidential Office )  Asked about Australia's strategic alliance with the US via the AUKUS pact, Mr Wu said Taiwan wanted to see Australia play an important role in the region.  ""We see that Australia seems to be determined to play a more significant role for the security in the Indo-Pacific. And this is a force for good,"" he said.  ""This is what we need for fellow democracies to guarantee this peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.""  Australia hasn't had a formal ministerial visit to Taiwan since 2012, although parliamentarians have regularly travelled to Taipei. Mr Wu highlighted visits by Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison.  He said he'd welcome more frequent engagements, and even a visit by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.  ""This is a decision to be made by the Australian government,"" he said. ""Any kind of exchange between Taiwan and Australia will be welcomed by the Taiwanese government and people.""  Avoiding conflict  Taipei says China has been trying to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. ( Reuters: Florence Lo )  Mr Wu says Taiwan has been working to preserve the status quo but he accuses China of inflaming tensions with threats of military intervention.  ""The general source of that peace and stability comes from Taiwan … Our like-minded partners, including Australia, have been taking concrete actions to deter the Chinese from using military force against Taiwan,"" he said.  The foreign minister says a conflict over Taiwan would damage the world.  ""The Taiwan Strait has about 50 per cent of the global goods floating through it. And therefore, if maritime transportation is interrupted, it will cause a problem for the rest of the world,"" he said.

A Melbourne doctor who forced an asylum seeker to work against his will at a sweet shop has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail. Seyyed Farshchi threatened to contact immigration authorities and have the victim deported, and paid him just $10 an hour for his work.  Seyyed Farshchi threatened to contact immigration authorities and have the victim deported, and paid him just $10 an hour for his work. What's Next? Farshchi will serve three and a half years in jail and has been ordered to pay $43,000 in reparations to the victim.  A Melbourne doctor has been jailed for three and a half years after using deportation threats to force a refugee to work at his sweet shop.  Seyyed Farshchi was sentenced in Victoria's County Court on Tuesday after being found guilty last year of two forced labour offences.  He was also ordered to pay nearly $43,000 in reparations to the victim, whom he forced to work for 20 months.  The court heard the victim, a refugee from Iran, arrived in Melbourne in 2015 looking for work and found a job advertisement for the Candoo Confectionery shop in Box Hill, which was then owned by Farshchi.  After an unpaid training period that lasted months, Farshchi began paying the victim just $10 an hour for work that he described as physically exhausting.  The victim said he was regularly forced to work 14-hour shifts at the shop, which Farshchi sold in 2018.  The refugee was forced to work long hours at the Box Hill shop for 20 months for little pay. ( ABC News: Peter Healy )  The court heard that the victim had only a rudimentary grasp of English, and had no knowledge of the Australian minimum wage or employment law.  County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd said Farshchi was acutely aware the victim was vulnerable to exploitation, and that before long the employment conditions ""took on a more sinister character"".  Carrot-and-stick approach used on victim, court told  Prosecutors argued Farshchi used a ""carrot-and-stick"" method to control his employee.  Claiming to have connections with the Department of Immigration, the doctor made repeated promises he would help with the victim's visa application and made assurances he would assist the victim to buy a home.  When this failed to come to fruition and the victim again raised the issue of his pay, Farshchi threatened to report the victim to Centrelink for working without paying tax and claimed he would use his connections to have the victim deported.  Seyyed Farshchi was charged in 2019 with causing a person to remain in forced labour.

( Facebook ) abc.net.au/news/sweet-shop-doctor-sayyed-farshchi-forced-labour/103404718 Copy link Link copied Share Share article In Short: A Melbourne doctor who forced an asylum seeker to work against his will at a sweet shop has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail. Seyyed Farshchi threatened to contact immigration authorities and have the victim deported, and paid him just $10 an hour for his work. What's Next? Farshchi will serve three and a half years in jail and has been ordered to pay $43,000 in reparations to the victim. A Melbourne doctor has been jailed for three and a half years after using deportation threats to force a refugee to work at his sweet shop. Seyyed Farshchi was sentenced in Victoria's County Court on Tuesday after being found guilty last year of two forced labour offences . He was also ordered to pay nearly $43,000 in reparations to the victim, whom he forced to work for 20 months. The court heard the victim, a refugee from Iran, arrived in Melbourne in 2015 looking for work and found a job advertisement for the Candoo Confectionery shop in Box Hill, which was then owned by Farshchi. After an unpaid training period that lasted months, Farshchi began paying the victim just $10 an hour for work that he described as physically exhausting. The victim said he was regularly forced to work 14-hour shifts at the shop, which Farshchi sold in 2018. The refugee was forced to work long hours at the Box Hill shop for 20 months for little pay. ( ABC News: Peter Healy ) The court heard that the victim had only a rudimentary grasp of English, and had no knowledge of the Australian minimum wage or employment law. County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd said Farshchi was acutely aware the victim was vulnerable to exploitation, and that before long the employment conditions ""took on a more sinister character"". Carrot-and-stick approach used on victim, court told Prosecutors argued Farshchi used a ""carrot-and-stick"" method to control his employee. Claiming to have connections with the Department of Immigration, the doctor made repeated promises he would help with the victim's visa application and made assurances he would assist the victim to buy a home. When this failed to come to fruition and the victim again raised the issue of his pay, Farshchi threatened to report the victim to Centrelink for working without paying tax and claimed he would use his connections to have the victim deported. Seyyed Farshchi was charged in 2019 with causing a person to remain in forced labour. ( ABC News: Karen Percy ) Farshchi also threatened to divulge that the victim had converted to Christianity, claiming that he would be killed for it when deported back to Iran. ""The hope and optimism I had for my future and my family has been stolen from me,"" the victim told the court.

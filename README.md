## Project Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of data extraction from various online sources. Initially focused on scraping data from Google using predefined links, it offers the flexibility to adapt and extract data solely from RSS feeds as well.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Capable of scraping information directly from Google search results or RSS feeds, providing a versatile approach to data gathering.
- **Content Summarization**: Utilizes advanced language models such as GPT-4 or Misteral, among others, to condense the extracted data into concise summaries. This feature simplifies the assimilation of information, making it easier to understand the essence of the content at a glance.
- **Image Summaries (Future Implementation)**: Plans to integrate an image chat feature to generate visual summaries and identify the most relevant images corresponding to the textual news summaries. This enhancement aims to provide a more comprehensive and engaging summary by combining both textual and visual elements.

## How It Works
The process begins with the specification of URLs from which the data is to be scraped. The system then retrieves the content from these links and employs cutting-edge language models to generate succinct and informative summaries of the extracted data.

## Upcoming Features
Image Chat Integration: We're exploring the potential of adding an image chat feature to create visual summaries and select the most pertinent images for each news summary. This will provide a more immersive summary experience by incorporating visual aids alongside the textual content.

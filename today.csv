Arguing Britain and its allies must maintain sanctions and military support for Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” the panel from parliament’s unelected upper House of Lords urged them to take “decisive action” over the issue. It comes just over a year after the G7, European Union and Australia imposed the unprecedented price cap on Russian oil, hoping to starve President Vladimir Putin of much-needed revenue while ensuring he still supplied the global market. Initially successful, the $60 per barrel price ceiling on Russian oil lost its impact once Moscow found new buyers and new tankers to deliver its exports. Recent assessments show Moscow has reduced its dependence on Western shipping services and skirted the curb by building so-called shadow fleets of tankers and buying old ships while offering its own insurance services. “We are concerned at the growing evidence that Russia has been able to circumvent sanctions, including through third states and uninsured shadow tanker fleets,” the Lords’ European Affairs Committee said in a new report. “This is an issue where decisive action by the UK and its allies is needed,” it added, urging the government to detail “specific examples” of enforcement action. Companies based in the EU, G7 member states and Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, of oil above that price. But the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) is the latest to highlight the extent to which Russia is now able to get around the mechanism. In its December “Russian oil tracker” report released earlier this month, it estimated “179 loaded Russian shadow fleet tankers left Russian ports in November 2023.” Around 70 percent of the vessels were built more than 15 years ago, it said. In October 2023, the shadow fleet was responsible for exports of around 2.3 million barrels per day of crude oil and 800,000 million barrels per day of petroleum products, according to the KSE. The Lords’ committee welcomed the Western sanctions regime imposed on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, in particular that it had been “broadly aligned,” but warned against “divergence.” “Divergence between sanctions regimes results in gaps and loopholes, weakening their effectiveness; it should be as limited as possible.” Follow Topics: British lawmakers Russia Oil sanctions Related 2723 Business & Economy Russia oil output exceeds expectation, but pressure looms, IEA chief says 2299 Business & Economy Restricting car use could offset Russia oil crisis, says IEA World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia /node/2451596/world World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia Updated 58 min 45 sec ago Reuters January 31, 2024 19:36 199 Follow World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia Judges at the ICJ found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv Updated 58 min 45 sec ago Reuters January 31, 2024 19:36 199 THE HAGUE: Judges at the top UN court on Wednesday found that Russia violated elements of a UN anti-terrorism treaty, but declined to rule on allegations brought by Kyiv that Moscow was responsible for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. In the same ruling, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty by failing to support Ukrainian language education in Crimea after its 2014 annexation of the peninsula. The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv. The court rejected Ukraine’s requests to order reparations for both violations and only ordered Russia to comply with the treaties. Ukraine had filed the lawsuit at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, in 2017, accusing Russia of violating an anti-terrorism treaty by funding pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. The court’s judges said Moscow violated the UN’s anti-terrorism treaty by not investigating plausible allegations that some funds were sent from Russia to Ukraine to possibly fund terrorist activities. The 16-judge panel ordered Russia to investigate any plausible allegations of terrorism financing but turned down a request by Kyiv for reparations. The court declined to rule on the downing of MH17, saying violations of funding terrorism only applied to monetary and financial support, not to supplying weapons or training alleged by Ukraine. Ukraine had argued that in the case of MH17, Russia supplied the missile system that shot down the aircraft, but it had not alleged financial support in that instance. In a hearing at the court in The Hague last June, Russia dismissed Ukraine’s allegations that it funded and controlled pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as fiction and “blatant lies.” In the case, which has taken almost seven years, Kyiv had accused Russia of equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including rebels who shot down MH17 in July 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. In November 2022, a Dutch court sentenced two Russians and a Ukrainian in absentia to life imprisonment for their role in the disaster. In Crimea, Ukraine had said Russia was trying to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians. The court dismissed all of the claims related to the Tatars but found Moscow did not do enough to support Ukrainian language education. The court’s judgments are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Ukraine has accused Moscow of falsely applying the 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion.

An area around the object was closed off and Wikdahl added that the national bomb squad had been called to scene and had decided to destroy the object. “The object has been destroyed by the national bomb squad, and our assessment is that it was live,” the police officer said. Police have opened an investigation, but Wikdahl declined to specify what the object was, citing the ongoing enquiries. “Today we were subject to an attempted attack against the Embassy of Israel in Stockholm and its employees,” Israeli ambassador to Sweden Ziv Nevo Kulman said in a post to X. “We will not be intimidated by terror,” Kulman added. Sweden’s government in late October pledged 10 million kronor ($1 million) in to increase security at Jewish institutions and congregations, as a result of increased anti-semitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. In early December, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson took part in a march against anti-semitism in Stockholm. Swedish police said at the time, they had received 120 reports of ant-semitic crimes since the outbreak of the war. Following the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive. It has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.

The Russian Defense Ministry said each side had got 195 soldiers back and that its own soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the defense ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelensky. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of PoWs said that what was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind had returned home soldiers involved in the defense of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. It said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and said that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on Jan. 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the United Arab Emirates. Russia says Ukraine shot down the plane carrying prisoners for last week’s swap with a ground-to-air missile and that all 74 people on board were killed. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, and has demanded proof of who was on board.

The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since the February 2021 coup which ended a ten-year experiment with democracy and sparked mass protests and a crackdown on dissent. Three years on, the junta is struggling to crush widespread armed opposition to its rule and recently suffered a series of stunning setbacks to an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups. Acting president U Myint Swe “announced the extension of the state of emergency for another six months” at a meeting of the national defense and security council, the junta said in a statement. The extension of the state of emergency — due to expire at midnight on Wednesday — was needed to “continue the process of combatting terrorists,” the statement added. The council discussed “preparations for holding multi-party elections” and the holding of a national census at a meeting in the military-built capital Naypyidaw, it said, without giving details. The military declared a state of emergency when it ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government in February 2021, citing unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud in 2020 elections her party won in a landslide. It has extended the state of emergency multiple times since, delaying fresh elections it has promised to hold. Myanmar’s military-drafted 2008 constitution, which the junta has said is still in force, requires authorities to hold fresh elections within six months of a state of emergency being lifted. A surprise offensive in late October by an alliance of ethnic armed groups in northern Shan state sent the junta reeling. The Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) seized roads to the country’s biggest trading partner China and captured dozens of military outposts. Troops surrendered in their thousands and military units fled into India and China, prompting rare public criticism of the junta leadership by its supporters. A China-brokered peace deal has since paused the fighting in the north, but the alliance has largely kept its recent gains and clashes continue elsewhere. The setbacks have also galvanized pro-democracy groups to renew their attacks on the military elsewhere in the country. Independent Myanmar analyst David Mathieson said the move was “a totally expected extension for a crumbling regime.” More than 4,400 people have been killed in the military’s crackdown on dissent and over 25,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group. The junta has said that “terrorists” opposing its rule have killed more than 6,000 civilians. More than two million people have been displaced by violence since the putsch, according to the United Nations.

In the interim budget ahead of general elections by May, Modi’s government is expected to focus on infrastructure spending to improve the economy’s long-term prospects, officials said. The economy is projected to grow 7.3 percent in the fiscal year ending March, the highest rate among major global economies. However, growth in farm output, which contributes about 15 percent of GDP and employs more than 40 percent of the workforce, was seen slowing to 1.8 percent in the current fiscal year, from 4 percent a year ago. ECONOMIC OUTPUT The Indian economy is projected to grow around 7 percent in the next financial year that starts from April 1, and there is “considerable scope” for India to grow above 7 percent by 2030, according to government estimates. INFLATION After low retail inflation during the first term of Modi till mid-2019, the economy has seen rises in retail prices, driven by post-pandemic global supply disruptions, higher import tariffs and an increase in global commodity prices. Retail inflation in 2022/23 accelerated to 6.7 percent from 5.5 percent in 2021/22, and 6.2 percent the year ago. The cost of living for the poor has sharply risen in last five years due to a surge in food prices. FISCAL DEFICIT Modi’s administration has justified higher government borrowing to fund a widening fiscal deficit — the gap between income and spending — to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to boost infrastructure spending. The fiscal deficit could remain at 5.9 percent of GDP in 2023/24 after ballooning to 9.3 percent in 2020-21, during the pandemic. The federal fiscal deficit in 2013/14 was 4.6 percent of GDP when Modi took charge. UNEMPLOYMENT Modi faces criticism for not creating enough jobs despite offering billions of dollars in subsidies to boost manufacturing. The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in 2022/23, from 4.9 percent in 2013/14, according to government estimates. Nearly 16 percent of urban youth in the age group of 15-29 years remained unemployed in 2022/23, due to poor skills and lack of quality jobs, government data showed. Estimates by private agencies are much higher. RISING DEBT India’s public debt remains elevated and is expected to rise to 82.3 percent of GDP by 2024/25, according to IMF estimates. Government payouts for servicing its debt are estimated to increase to over 40 percent of total revenue receipts in the current fiscal year. General government debt, which includes federal and state government debt, could be 100 percent of GDP under adverse circumstances by fiscal 2028, the IMF said. PRIVATISATION The government met its privatization target only twice in the last decade, with the notable sale of Air India while it deferred stake sales in state-run banks and companies. In 2023/24, the government may not be able raise even 300 billion rupees through stake sales, less than 40 percent of budget target. HOUSING BOOM Modi’s government has subsidised construction of concrete houses for around 40 million impoverished households in a decade, and raised spending to build rural roads. The federal and state governments have spent $29 billion over the last five years on housing subsidies. Opposition parties, however, say the program missed its original deadline of 2022. DOUBLING FARMERS’ INCOME Modi’s critics said his government has not fulfilled the poll promise of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. However, the government says steps like cash payouts to farmers, and raising crop procurement prices, among others, has helped in augmenting farmers’ income.

After two years of intermittent lockdowns and restrictions on what people could and could not do, in February 2022 the government lifted all legal Covid rules as members of the public were asked to practice safe and responsible behaviours.  People were no longer required to wear masks in public places, limit the number of people they could see, or provide negative Covid tests to enter some venues as had been the case during previous lockdowns.  Experts say it’s important for people to do what they can to reduce transmission of Covid, including getting a vaccine for those who are eligible (PA)  After most people got vaccinated against the virus, the UK began to follow a “living with Covid” strategy as health officials sought to “manage the infection like other respiratory illnesses” such as the cold and flu.  But while virus restrictions have been lifted, Covid continues circulating in the UK. But just how prevalent is it, how is it affecting the NHS and are people still dying from the illness?  How many people have Covid?  The estimated prevalence of Covid in England and Scotland was 2.3 per cent ( around 1,352,000 people) according to the most recently available official data from 10 January 2024.  The Office for National Statistics (ONS) and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) winter infection study estimates the number of people who have Covid because it is no longer mandatory for people to report their test results if they get infected.  The most recent report said the prevalence of Covid in England and Scotland had decreased in the TWO weeks leading up to 10 January 2024.”  It was down from 4.1 per cent on 27 December 2023 and remains much lower than the rate seen during previous waves of the virus.  Professor Steven Riley, director general for data and surveillance at UKHSA said the figures confirmed the early signs of a decline in Covid across the country.  But he warned that this did not mean the risk of becoming ill with Covid has gone away.  A view of the National Covid Memorial Wall in London (EPA)  “In previous years, we have sometimes seen a decline in early January followed by an increase over the next few weeks, so it remains important that we continue to do what we can to reduce transmission,” he said.  Those people who are most at risk of severe illness from Covid can still receive a seasonal vaccination until the end of this month, and we urge anyone eligible who has not already done so to come forward.”  How many people are in hospital with Covid?  Far fewer people are being admitted to hospital with Covid than during previous years, although a significant are still ending up on wards for treatment.  According to official data, 3,790 people were admitted to hospital with Covid between 12 and 19 January.  This is compared with a peak of 38,000 people in the week to 20 January 2021.  How many people are dying from Covid?  In the week ending 12 January 2024, there were 388 deaths involving Covid in England and Wales and 277 deaths due to Covid, according to official data.  The most deaths reported on a single day at the height of the pandemic was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 fatalities were logged.","UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers | Arab News Arab News Arab News PK Arab News JP Arab News FR Wednesday .  January 31, 2024 Search form Search Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Search form Search Latest News Saudi Arabia Saudi Football Middle-East Football Business & Economy Saudi FM receives phone call from Iranian counterpart Evidence of rheumatoid arthritis found for first time in human remains from ancient Egypt Australian defender Aziz Behich becomes Ronaldo’s new teammate at Al-Nassr Saudi crown prince, UK foreign secretary discuss regional developments Saudi deputy FM, UK minister discuss travel scheme for Saudi visitors US targets Iranian, Hezbollah financial network with sanctions Israel strikes Gaza, regional tensions high as Hamas studies ceasefire proposal Saudi Arabia mulls selling additional stake in Aramco: Bloomberg Japan advance to the Asian Cup quarterfinals with 3-1 win against Bahrain WHO chief says defunding UNRWA will have ‘catastrophic’ consequences Previous Pause Next You are here Home UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers /node/2451206/world UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers The $60 per barrel price ceiling on Russian oil lost its impact once Moscow found new buyers and new tankers to deliver its exports.

In a hearing at the court in The Hague last June, Russia dismissed Ukraine’s allegations that it funded and controlled pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as fiction and “blatant lies.” In the case, which has taken almost seven years, Kyiv had accused Russia of equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including rebels who shot down MH17 in July 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. In November 2022, a Dutch court sentenced two Russians and a Ukrainian in absentia to life imprisonment for their role in the disaster. In Crimea, Ukraine had said Russia was trying to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians. The court dismissed all of the claims related to the Tatars but found Moscow did not do enough to support Ukrainian language education. The court’s judgments are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Ukraine has accused Moscow of falsely applying the 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion.

An area around the object was closed off and Wikdahl added that the national bomb squad had been called to scene and had decided to destroy the object. “The object has been destroyed by the national bomb squad, and our assessment is that it was live,” the police officer said. Police have opened an investigation, but Wikdahl declined to specify what the object was, citing the ongoing enquiries. “Today we were subject to an attempted attack against the Embassy of Israel in Stockholm and its employees,” Israeli ambassador to Sweden Ziv Nevo Kulman said in a post to X. “We will not be intimidated by terror,” Kulman added. Sweden’s government in late October pledged 10 million kronor ($1 million) in to increase security at Jewish institutions and congregations, as a result of increased anti-semitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. In early December, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson took part in a march against anti-semitism in Stockholm. Swedish police said at the time, they had received 120 reports of ant-semitic crimes since the outbreak of the war. Following the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive. It has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.

The Russian Defense Ministry said each side had got 195 soldiers back and that its own soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the defense ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelensky. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of PoWs said that what was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind had returned home soldiers involved in the defense of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. It said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and said that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on Jan. 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the United Arab Emirates. Russia says Ukraine shot down the plane carrying prisoners for last week’s swap with a ground-to-air missile and that all 74 people on board were killed. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, and has demanded proof of who was on board.

The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since the February 2021 coup which ended a ten-year experiment with democracy and sparked mass protests and a crackdown on dissent. Three years on, the junta is struggling to crush widespread armed opposition to its rule and recently suffered a series of stunning setbacks to an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups. Acting president U Myint Swe “announced the extension of the state of emergency for another six months” at a meeting of the national defense and security council, the junta said in a statement. The extension of the state of emergency — due to expire at midnight on Wednesday — was needed to “continue the process of combatting terrorists,” the statement added. The council discussed “preparations for holding multi-party elections” and the holding of a national census at a meeting in the military-built capital Naypyidaw, it said, without giving details. The military declared a state of emergency when it ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government in February 2021, citing unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud in 2020 elections her party won in a landslide. It has extended the state of emergency multiple times since, delaying fresh elections it has promised to hold. Myanmar’s military-drafted 2008 constitution, which the junta has said is still in force, requires authorities to hold fresh elections within six months of a state of emergency being lifted. A surprise offensive in late October by an alliance of ethnic armed groups in northern Shan state sent the junta reeling. The Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) seized roads to the country’s biggest trading partner China and captured dozens of military outposts. Troops surrendered in their thousands and military units fled into India and China, prompting rare public criticism of the junta leadership by its supporters. A China-brokered peace deal has since paused the fighting in the north, but the alliance has largely kept its recent gains and clashes continue elsewhere. The setbacks have also galvanized pro-democracy groups to renew their attacks on the military elsewhere in the country. Independent Myanmar analyst David Mathieson said the move was “a totally expected extension for a crumbling regime.” More than 4,400 people have been killed in the military’s crackdown on dissent and over 25,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group. The junta has said that “terrorists” opposing its rule have killed more than 6,000 civilians. More than two million people have been displaced by violence since the putsch, according to the United Nations.

In the interim budget ahead of general elections by May, Modi’s government is expected to focus on infrastructure spending to improve the economy’s long-term prospects, officials said. The economy is projected to grow 7.3 percent in the fiscal year ending March, the highest rate among major global economies. However, growth in farm output, which contributes about 15 percent of GDP and employs more than 40 percent of the workforce, was seen slowing to 1.8 percent in the current fiscal year, from 4 percent a year ago. ECONOMIC OUTPUT The Indian economy is projected to grow around 7 percent in the next financial year that starts from April 1, and there is “considerable scope” for India to grow above 7 percent by 2030, according to government estimates. INFLATION After low retail inflation during the first term of Modi till mid-2019, the economy has seen rises in retail prices, driven by post-pandemic global supply disruptions, higher import tariffs and an increase in global commodity prices. Retail inflation in 2022/23 accelerated to 6.7 percent from 5.5 percent in 2021/22, and 6.2 percent the year ago. The cost of living for the poor has sharply risen in last five years due to a surge in food prices. FISCAL DEFICIT Modi’s administration has justified higher government borrowing to fund a widening fiscal deficit — the gap between income and spending — to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to boost infrastructure spending. The fiscal deficit could remain at 5.9 percent of GDP in 2023/24 after ballooning to 9.3 percent in 2020-21, during the pandemic. The federal fiscal deficit in 2013/14 was 4.6 percent of GDP when Modi took charge. UNEMPLOYMENT Modi faces criticism for not creating enough jobs despite offering billions of dollars in subsidies to boost manufacturing. The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in 2022/23, from 4.9 percent in 2013/14, according to government estimates. Nearly 16 percent of urban youth in the age group of 15-29 years remained unemployed in 2022/23, due to poor skills and lack of quality jobs, government data showed. Estimates by private agencies are much higher. RISING DEBT India’s public debt remains elevated and is expected to rise to 82.3 percent of GDP by 2024/25, according to IMF estimates. Government payouts for servicing its debt are estimated to increase to over 40 percent of total revenue receipts in the current fiscal year. General government debt, which includes federal and state government debt, could be 100 percent of GDP under adverse circumstances by fiscal 2028, the IMF said. PRIVATISATION The government met its privatization target only twice in the last decade, with the notable sale of Air India while it deferred stake sales in state-run banks and companies. In 2023/24, the government may not be able raise even 300 billion rupees through stake sales, less than 40 percent of budget target. HOUSING BOOM Modi’s government has subsidised construction of concrete houses for around 40 million impoverished households in a decade, and raised spending to build rural roads. The federal and state governments have spent $29 billion over the last five years on housing subsidies. Opposition parties, however, say the program missed its original deadline of 2022. DOUBLING FARMERS’ INCOME Modi’s critics said his government has not fulfilled the poll promise of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. However, the government says steps like cash payouts to farmers, and raising crop procurement prices, among others, has helped in augmenting farmers’ income.

6,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13026501/Man-beheads-federal-employee-father-posts-video-decapitated-head-YouTube.html,"A self-proclaimed 'messiah' decapitated his 68-year-old father - then held up the victim's head in a politically-charged YouTube video blasting the federal government and the Biden administration.  Justin Mohn, 32, is in custody in Pennsylvania after his father Michael was found by his wife, beheaded, inside the home that the trio shared in the quiet Philadelphia suburb of Levittown.  The alleged killer's mother called police to report that she discovered her husband's body inside the bathroom and he had no head, according to court documents seem by LevvitownNow.  Police then recovered a large kitchen knife and a machete from the bathtub, after finding the man's head inside of a plastic bag which was placed in a cooking pot in a bedroom.  Hours before his arrest, Mohn held up what he claimed was his father's head during a politically charged rant in which he claimed that he was the president of the United State that he posted on his YouTube channel.  Mohn said many saw him as the messiah, and wanted him as president, while urging relatives living with federal employees to murder them. He blamed the federal government for 'woke mobs' and migrants he claims are destroying the United States, and ranted against 'globalists and communists'.  Justin Mohn pictured during the grotesque video in which he apparently brandished his father's severed head while saying his dad was 'in hell'  Justin Mohn's father, Michael, and his mother, Denice. Michael was found beheaded in a bathroom on Tuesday at the family home  The house is pictured on Tuesday night with officers outside and crime scene tape  The appalling 14 minute clip - which remained on YouTube for six hours after it was posted at 5:30pm, before being taken down - sees Mohn hold up his father's head in a bloodied plastic bag, having declared: 'Violence is the only solution to the federal government's treason.'  He says: 'This is the head of Mike Mohn, a federal employee of over 20 years and my father. He is now in hell for eternity as a traitor to his country.'  DailyMail.com has been unable to confirm whether Mike Mohn was a federal employee. Retirement age for federal employees is typically 62 years old.  DailyMail.com has chosen to obscure the disturbing images from the clip. Officially, police have called Michael Mohn's death as 'suspicious.'  LevitttownNow said Mohn was arrested after 9pm ET on Tuesday, in Fort Indiana Gap in central Pennsylvania, around two hours from his last known residence, driving his father's car. He will be taken back to Bucks County, where his father was found dead.  Police first located his car and then arrested the suspect nearby.  They confirmed the victim had been beheaded and that the YouTube video was part of the same investigation.  Police were first called to the house just after 7pm on Tuesday and found a headless body in its bathroom, said Chief Joe Bartorilla of Middletown Police Department.  The police charging documents showing that Mohn will be charged with murder in the first degree, abuse of a corpse and possession of an instrument of crime with intent  'We got called to the home and officers went in and discovered the father upstairs deceased,' he said.  'We're getting contacted by some people in the community that know us, and know him and his family.  'And we're hearing a lot. Obviously he's well known in the community just by the calls we're getting.'  Bartorilla said he had warned the family about the video.  'I know he has siblings. We have told (the victim's wife) to notify them before they see the video, or the video is sent to them,' he added.  Mohn is listed as living there with his father; his mother Denice, 63; his brother Zachary, 35, and his sister Stephanie, 38.  His father is believed to have owned two businesses - a cleaning company, and a literacy initiative, neither of which appear to be linked to the federal government.  Another older photo shows Mohn holding up a CD. He was arrested Tuesday night, two hours drive from his family's home  From right: Justin Mohn, his father Michael and mother Denice; Zachary Mohn, with his girlfriend Cherry, and Stephanie Mohn  Justin Mohn's brother Zachary and his girlfriend Cherry. It is unclear where they were at the time of the murder  Justin Mohn was arrested on Tuesday, 100 miles from the family home  The video was posted on Mohn's YouTube channel, where he had 115 followers. There are now only four videos on the channel, which feature him singing out of tune and playing music, with a photo of his face.  In the beheading clip, he rants about taxes, declaring that the economy is 'near destruction' and most Americans can 'no longer afford the American dream.'  Mohn went on to say he was offering a $1 million bounty to anyone who could kill top officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland and former Attorney General Bill Barr.  He said there was a 'globalist and communist' plot against the United State, before ranting about the federal government and holding up his dad's head in a silver bucket.  Mohn's rant continued, addressing US postal workers, journalists, federal debt and the federal reserve, the border crisis, Antifa and the woke agenda.  Justin Mohr, far right, is seen with his siblings in a photo from their mother's Facebook page  Denice Mohr, Justin's mother. It is unclear where she was at the time of the murder  He said 'the traitorous Biden regime' wanted to send 'America's military overseas to fight for Ukraine and die in a Russian winter.'  Mohn ranted against 'tax-evading big tech companies' and those behind the U.S. prison system.  Mohn railed against a 'network of evil' he said was 'plaguing' America.  He claimed to have worked as a contractor for Microsoft, and saw how the company was 'evading billions of dollars in taxes'. He claimed he 'whistleblew to the IRS about five years ago, but they simply looked the other way.'  Mohn said he had uncovered a scheme while living in Colorado, whereby the companies created 'a constant level of unemployment, and a constant level of homelessness, and a constant level of crime, to fill up the prisons.'  Mohn said: 'When I filed a complaint to the FBI of this labor racketing, they showed up at my door to threaten me with arrest.'  Justin Mohn is seen in his YouTube video, uploaded at 5:30pm on Tuesday, ranting against the federal government, the Biden administration, migrants and the LGBTQ community  The deeply disturbed Mohn said 'Satan wants America to fall so he can unleash his plan on the world.'  Mohn then proclaimed: 'I and many other leaders know how to fix America, but we have to fight for it.'  He said many within the political parties saw him as the best candidate for president before the 2020 election - and said the former governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, and former governor of Ohio, John Kasich, would confirm his story, because their 2020 campaigns 'were sacrificed for me'.  Mohn said he felt he could have been 'the first unanimously-elected candidate for both parties since George Washington.'  He added: 'But I was betrayed by the FBI, the federal courts, and my own family, because there are people who believe I am the messiah. This belief that I am the messiah is why you have never heard this story on the news, because it would spread that belief.  'I'm not saying I am the messiah, as I would never compare myself to Jesus Christ. I'm just saying, that's why I was betrayed.'  And he ended by quoting the Bible at length, saying he had 'a sacred task.'  Mohn set about trying to make a career in music, with albums he put on his YouTube channel  One of Mohn's self-published books, which expand on his claim to be a messiah  Clues to Mohn's downwards spiral are to be found in a legal battle against the United States government, with Mohn suing them for negligently providing him with a student loan which made him 'an overeducated white man', unable to find work.  Mohn, in a filing made shortly before Christmas, sought to blame the government for his woes. The filing was the fourth time Mohn attempted to sue, seeking $10 million in damages from the federal government - a case which has no legal grounds.  He said in the filing that he was a 2014 graduate of Pennsylvania State University, with a degree in agribusiness management.  According to his complaint, Mohn 'began paying his monthly student loan six months later. But then Mr Mohn could not find a full-time job at some unpleaded later time. He obtained only part-time jobs.'  Mohn said he then moved to Colorado, to take a full-time job at a credit union, and later took a job with an insurance company.  But, according to his complaint, he saw 'his work post-graduate years as 'malemployment.''  In previous social media posts, Mohn ranted about a 'civil war' between him and his followers and what he calls 'The Cult.'  In one unhinged post, he wrote: 'Even my own family upholds this Cult belief and is willing to go to jail to prove it. Donald Trump, if this does not get fixed ASAP then you will also be in jail for the rest of your life after I sue you for everything you own - that's not a threat that's a promise b****.'  The alleged killer's Facebook accounts appear to have been taken down as of Wednesday morning, and his name is not searchable on X.  Mohn appears to have wanted to carve out a career as a musician.  On his YouTube page, he writes: 'Justin Mohn released his first album, 'The Story Of Humanity,' in September of 2017. His second album, 'Colofunkinrado,' was released September of 2018. His music style is a blend of rock, funk, and hip-hop, using piano and organ as primary instruments along with explicit lyrics, drums, synthesized bass, and other synthesized instruments.'  Mohn, who lived in Colorado after failing to find work in Pennsylvania, tried to be a musician and an author  Mohn also wrote poetry and conspiracy-laden manifestos.  One of his books was entitled: 'Poems I Wrote While Stoned: A Collection Of Poems'.  Another, 'The Punishing,' is set in the year 2481, with Satan ruling the world.  'After rejecting their Messiah and straying from the word of God, humanity falls under complete control of Satan and his minions – a race of artificially modified humans, who no longer call themselves Homo Sapiens, but rather, Homo Demonicus,' the blurb reads.  Another appeared to preview his warped plan, entitled: 'America's Coming Bloody Revolution.'  Its blurb reads: 'Similar to Thomas Paine's 'Common Sense' published in 1776 which helped inspire the American Revolution, the short, easy to understand pamphlet explains why another revolution is likely in America… and how it could be successful.'","UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers | Arab News Arab News Arab News PK Arab News JP Arab News FR Wednesday .  January 31, 2024 Search form Search Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Saudi Arabia News The Place The Space Who's Who KSA Today Middle East World Business Insight Corporate News Media MEDIA POWER LISTS Lifestyle Art & Culture fashion Offbeat Travel Entertainment Food & Health The Six Books & Gaming Opinion Editorial Sport Saudi Football Football Motorsport Tennis Cricket Golf E-sport Podcast Research & Studies Research Papers YouGov Deep Dive Preachers of Hate Podcast Search form Search Latest News Saudi Arabia Saudi Football Middle-East Football Business & Economy Saudi FM receives phone call from Iranian counterpart Evidence of rheumatoid arthritis found for first time in human remains from ancient Egypt Australian defender Aziz Behich becomes Ronaldo’s new teammate at Al-Nassr Saudi crown prince, UK foreign secretary discuss regional developments Saudi deputy FM, UK minister discuss travel scheme for Saudi visitors US targets Iranian, Hezbollah financial network with sanctions Israel strikes Gaza, regional tensions high as Hamas studies ceasefire proposal Saudi Arabia mulls selling additional stake in Aramco: Bloomberg Japan advance to the Asian Cup quarterfinals with 3-1 win against Bahrain WHO chief says defunding UNRWA will have ‘catastrophic’ consequences Previous Pause Next You are here Home UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers /node/2451206/world UK lawmakers warn Russia skirting oil sanctions with ‘shadow’ tankers The $60 per barrel price ceiling on Russian oil lost its impact once Moscow found new buyers and new tankers to deliver its exports.

Arguing Britain and its allies must maintain sanctions and military support for Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” the panel from parliament’s unelected upper House of Lords urged them to take “decisive action” over the issue. It comes just over a year after the G7, European Union and Australia imposed the unprecedented price cap on Russian oil, hoping to starve President Vladimir Putin of much-needed revenue while ensuring he still supplied the global market. Initially successful, the $60 per barrel price ceiling on Russian oil lost its impact once Moscow found new buyers and new tankers to deliver its exports. Recent assessments show Moscow has reduced its dependence on Western shipping services and skirted the curb by building so-called shadow fleets of tankers and buying old ships while offering its own insurance services. “We are concerned at the growing evidence that Russia has been able to circumvent sanctions, including through third states and uninsured shadow tanker fleets,” the Lords’ European Affairs Committee said in a new report. “This is an issue where decisive action by the UK and its allies is needed,” it added, urging the government to detail “specific examples” of enforcement action. Companies based in the EU, G7 member states and Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, of oil above that price. But the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) is the latest to highlight the extent to which Russia is now able to get around the mechanism. In its December “Russian oil tracker” report released earlier this month, it estimated “179 loaded Russian shadow fleet tankers left Russian ports in November 2023.” Around 70 percent of the vessels were built more than 15 years ago, it said. In October 2023, the shadow fleet was responsible for exports of around 2.3 million barrels per day of crude oil and 800,000 million barrels per day of petroleum products, according to the KSE. The Lords’ committee welcomed the Western sanctions regime imposed on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, in particular that it had been “broadly aligned,” but warned against “divergence.” “Divergence between sanctions regimes results in gaps and loopholes, weakening their effectiveness; it should be as limited as possible.” Follow Topics: British lawmakers Russia Oil sanctions Related 2723 Business & Economy Russia oil output exceeds expectation, but pressure looms, IEA chief says 2299 Business & Economy Restricting car use could offset Russia oil crisis, says IEA World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia /node/2451596/world World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia Updated 58 min 45 sec ago Reuters January 31, 2024 19:36 199 Follow World Court dismisses much of Ukraine’s case against Russia Judges at the ICJ found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv Updated 58 min 45 sec ago Reuters January 31, 2024 19:36 199 THE HAGUE: Judges at the top UN court on Wednesday found that Russia violated elements of a UN anti-terrorism treaty, but declined to rule on allegations brought by Kyiv that Moscow was responsible for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. In the same ruling, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty by failing to support Ukrainian language education in Crimea after its 2014 annexation of the peninsula. The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv. The court rejected Ukraine’s requests to order reparations for both violations and only ordered Russia to comply with the treaties. Ukraine had filed the lawsuit at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, in 2017, accusing Russia of violating an anti-terrorism treaty by funding pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. The court’s judges said Moscow violated the UN’s anti-terrorism treaty by not investigating plausible allegations that some funds were sent from Russia to Ukraine to possibly fund terrorist activities. The 16-judge panel ordered Russia to investigate any plausible allegations of terrorism financing but turned down a request by Kyiv for reparations. The court declined to rule on the downing of MH17, saying violations of funding terrorism only applied to monetary and financial support, not to supplying weapons or training alleged by Ukraine. Ukraine had argued that in the case of MH17, Russia supplied the missile system that shot down the aircraft, but it had not alleged financial support in that instance. In a hearing at the court in The Hague last June, Russia dismissed Ukraine’s allegations that it funded and controlled pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as fiction and “blatant lies.” In the case, which has taken almost seven years, Kyiv had accused Russia of equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including rebels who shot down MH17 in July 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. In November 2022, a Dutch court sentenced two Russians and a Ukrainian in absentia to life imprisonment for their role in the disaster. In Crimea, Ukraine had said Russia was trying to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians. The court dismissed all of the claims related to the Tatars but found Moscow did not do enough to support Ukrainian language education. The court’s judgments are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Ukraine has accused Moscow of falsely applying the 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion.

An area around the object was closed off and Wikdahl added that the national bomb squad had been called to scene and had decided to destroy the object. “The object has been destroyed by the national bomb squad, and our assessment is that it was live,” the police officer said. Police have opened an investigation, but Wikdahl declined to specify what the object was, citing the ongoing enquiries. “Today we were subject to an attempted attack against the Embassy of Israel in Stockholm and its employees,” Israeli ambassador to Sweden Ziv Nevo Kulman said in a post to X. “We will not be intimidated by terror,” Kulman added. Sweden’s government in late October pledged 10 million kronor ($1 million) in to increase security at Jewish institutions and congregations, as a result of increased anti-semitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. In early December, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson took part in a march against anti-semitism in Stockholm. Swedish police said at the time, they had received 120 reports of ant-semitic crimes since the outbreak of the war. Following the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive. It has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.

The Russian Defense Ministry said each side had got 195 soldiers back and that its own soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the defense ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelensky. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of PoWs said that what was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind had returned home soldiers involved in the defense of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. It said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and said that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on Jan. 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the United Arab Emirates. Russia says Ukraine shot down the plane carrying prisoners for last week’s swap with a ground-to-air missile and that all 74 people on board were killed. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, and has demanded proof of who was on board.

The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since the February 2021 coup which ended a ten-year experiment with democracy and sparked mass protests and a crackdown on dissent. Three years on, the junta is struggling to crush widespread armed opposition to its rule and recently suffered a series of stunning setbacks to an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups. Acting president U Myint Swe “announced the extension of the state of emergency for another six months” at a meeting of the national defense and security council, the junta said in a statement. The extension of the state of emergency — due to expire at midnight on Wednesday — was needed to “continue the process of combatting terrorists,” the statement added. The council discussed “preparations for holding multi-party elections” and the holding of a national census at a meeting in the military-built capital Naypyidaw, it said, without giving details. The military declared a state of emergency when it ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government in February 2021, citing unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud in 2020 elections her party won in a landslide. It has extended the state of emergency multiple times since, delaying fresh elections it has promised to hold. Myanmar’s military-drafted 2008 constitution, which the junta has said is still in force, requires authorities to hold fresh elections within six months of a state of emergency being lifted. A surprise offensive in late October by an alliance of ethnic armed groups in northern Shan state sent the junta reeling. The Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) seized roads to the country’s biggest trading partner China and captured dozens of military outposts. Troops surrendered in their thousands and military units fled into India and China, prompting rare public criticism of the junta leadership by its supporters. A China-brokered peace deal has since paused the fighting in the north, but the alliance has largely kept its recent gains and clashes continue elsewhere. The setbacks have also galvanized pro-democracy groups to renew their attacks on the military elsewhere in the country. Independent Myanmar analyst David Mathieson said the move was “a totally expected extension for a crumbling regime.” More than 4,400 people have been killed in the military’s crackdown on dissent and over 25,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group. The junta has said that “terrorists” opposing its rule have killed more than 6,000 civilians. More than two million people have been displaced by violence since the putsch, according to the United Nations.

In the interim budget ahead of general elections by May, Modi’s government is expected to focus on infrastructure spending to improve the economy’s long-term prospects, officials said. The economy is projected to grow 7.3 percent in the fiscal year ending March, the highest rate among major global economies. However, growth in farm output, which contributes about 15 percent of GDP and employs more than 40 percent of the workforce, was seen slowing to 1.8 percent in the current fiscal year, from 4 percent a year ago. ECONOMIC OUTPUT The Indian economy is projected to grow around 7 percent in the next financial year that starts from April 1, and there is “considerable scope” for India to grow above 7 percent by 2030, according to government estimates. INFLATION After low retail inflation during the first term of Modi till mid-2019, the economy has seen rises in retail prices, driven by post-pandemic global supply disruptions, higher import tariffs and an increase in global commodity prices. Retail inflation in 2022/23 accelerated to 6.7 percent from 5.5 percent in 2021/22, and 6.2 percent the year ago. The cost of living for the poor has sharply risen in last five years due to a surge in food prices. FISCAL DEFICIT Modi’s administration has justified higher government borrowing to fund a widening fiscal deficit — the gap between income and spending — to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to boost infrastructure spending. The fiscal deficit could remain at 5.9 percent of GDP in 2023/24 after ballooning to 9.3 percent in 2020-21, during the pandemic. The federal fiscal deficit in 2013/14 was 4.6 percent of GDP when Modi took charge. UNEMPLOYMENT Modi faces criticism for not creating enough jobs despite offering billions of dollars in subsidies to boost manufacturing. The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in 2022/23, from 4.9 percent in 2013/14, according to government estimates. Nearly 16 percent of urban youth in the age group of 15-29 years remained unemployed in 2022/23, due to poor skills and lack of quality jobs, government data showed. Estimates by private agencies are much higher. RISING DEBT India’s public debt remains elevated and is expected to rise to 82.3 percent of GDP by 2024/25, according to IMF estimates. Government payouts for servicing its debt are estimated to increase to over 40 percent of total revenue receipts in the current fiscal year. General government debt, which includes federal and state government debt, could be 100 percent of GDP under adverse circumstances by fiscal 2028, the IMF said. PRIVATISATION The government met its privatization target only twice in the last decade, with the notable sale of Air India while it deferred stake sales in state-run banks and companies. In 2023/24, the government may not be able raise even 300 billion rupees through stake sales, less than 40 percent of budget target. HOUSING BOOM Modi’s government has subsidised construction of concrete houses for around 40 million impoverished households in a decade, and raised spending to build rural roads. The federal and state governments have spent $29 billion over the last five years on housing subsidies. Opposition parties, however, say the program missed its original deadline of 2022. DOUBLING FARMERS’ INCOME Modi’s critics said his government has not fulfilled the poll promise of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. However, the government says steps like cash payouts to farmers, and raising crop procurement prices, among others, has helped in augmenting farmers’ income.

Here are five key moments from the day as the inquiry - currently sitting in Edinburgh - probes the devolved administration's response to the pandemic.  'Part of me wishes I wasn't first minister when COVID hit'  Ms Sturgeon fought back tears as she told the inquiry that a ""large part"" of her wishes she had not been Scotland's first minister when the pandemic first struck.  The inquiry heard last week how Ms Sturgeon branded Boris Johnson a ""f****** clown"" in a foul-mouthed message to her chief of staff as the then prime minister appeared on TV to announce the second national lockdown.  Giving evidence on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon told Jamie Dawson KC, counsel to the inquiry, that she thought Mr Johnson was the ""wrong person"" to be prime minister.  In response to whether she thought of herself to be ""precisely the right first minister for the job"", Ms Sturgeon replied tearfully: ""No, that's not how I would have thought of it at all.  ""I was the first minister when the pandemic struck. There's a large part of me wishes that I hadn't been.  ""But I was, and I wanted to be the best first minister I could be during that period. It is for others to judge the extent to which I succeeded.""

The inquiry has already heard how Ms Sturgeon and her deputy, John Swinney, failed to retain their informal messages - although correspondence saved by recipients has been submitted.  Professor Sir Gregor Smith, Scotland's chief medical officer, told colleagues to delete WhatsApp messages ""at the end of every day"", while national clinical director Professor Jason Leitch described the daily deletion of messages as a ""pre-bed ritual"".  Ms Sturgeon said she did not use informal messaging to make decision during the pandemic.  She initially told the inquiry her messages ""weren't retained"" - rather than deleted - in line with government policy.  Mr Dawson asked: ""But did you delete them?""  Ms Sturgeon replied: ""Yes, in the manner I have set out.""  Image: Ms Sturgeon was a near-constant presence on national TV during the pandemic. Pic: PA  The Glasgow Southside MSP also apologised for telling a journalist in August 2021 that she would hand over all of her messages despite knowing many of her WhatsApps had already been deleted.  Ms Sturgeon apologised to Mr Dawson if the answer to Channel 4's Ciaran Jenkins during a media briefing was ""not as clear"" as it should have been.  She gave a ""personal assurance"" that the inquiry has ""anything and everything germane to my decision-making during the process and the time period of the pandemic and the factors underpinning those decisions"".  'My chief regret is that we didn't lock down earlier'  Ms Sturgeon denied she ""jumped the gun"" on a decision to ban mass gatherings in March 2020.  Instead, she said one of her chief regrets was not announcing it earlier.  She said: ""Of the many regrets I have, probably chief of those is that we didn't lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.""  Earlier this week, Michael Gove told the inquiry that Ms Sturgeon broke confidentiality and ""jumped the gun"" when she announced a ban on mass gatherings in Scotland.  Ms Sturgeon refuted the criticism, stating: ""None of us were jumping the gun - we were arguably all going more slowly than we should have been.""  She announced the ban on 12 March 2020 despite a COBRA meeting called later that day to discuss the pandemic.  Ms Sturgeon said: ""We would obviously listen to other views at COBRA but this was a Scottish government decision to take.  ""I was increasingly concerned that we were not moving fast enough to deal with the rate of transmission of COVID.""  'I wish I could turn the clock back to reduce care home deaths'  Ms Sturgeon admitted there were ""flaws and deficiencies"" in care home guidance in the early part of the pandemic.  According to evidence heard earlier in the inquiry, 82% of the 3,595 patients discharged between 1 March and 21 April 2020 were not tested for the virus.  A Public Health Scotland report in 2020 also found more than 100 people who had previously tested positive for the virus were admitted from hospital to a care home before returning a negative test.  Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do not think we got everything right around care homes and I deeply regret that.  ""There were undoubtedly flaws and deficiencies in that guidance, but the advice at the time was isolation - keeping people as separate as possible - was the best way to protect people in care homes, and clearly that didn't have the effect that we wanted it to have.""  Image: Ms Sturgeon fighting back tears during her testimony  Under questioning from Kevin McCaffrey, representing the Scottish COVID Bereaved group, Ms Sturgeon was asked what she would have done differently in her approach to care homes.  She replied: ""I would do everything in my power, and I wish I could turn the clock back and do different things that would have reduced the loss of life in care homes.""  'I did not politicise a global pandemic'  Ms Sturgeon denied making decisions for political reasons, claiming she had not ""thought less"" about politics and Scottish independence in her life than she did during the pandemic.  The inquiry was earlier shown a cabinet document from July 2020 where Brexit and Scottish independence were referenced.  In the cabinet meeting it was agreed that consideration should be given to ""restarting work on independence"".  Ms Sturgeon said ""work did not restart"", adding: ""There was no prospect of starting work on independence at that time, but in any event it didn't happen.""  She claimed her government ""focused entirely"" on getting the country through COVID.  An email was also shown in which concern was raised that the Spanish government would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU if travel restrictions during the pandemic remained.  Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free  Mr Dawson asked Ms Sturgeon if using the pandemic to push for independence would be a ""considerable betrayal of the Scottish people"".  She replied: ""If I had at any point decided to politicise a global pandemic that was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods, and educational opportunities, and had decided in the face of that to prioritise campaigning for independence, then, yes, it absolutely would have been as you described.  ""Which is precisely why I didn't do it - I wouldn't have done it.""  Ms Sturgeon refuted a claim that she wanted to be the person that drove COVID out, admitting that she took it ""very, very personally"" when her motives during the pandemic are questioned.  She later said: ""People will make their own judgments about me, about my government, about my decisions, but for as long as I live, I will carry the impact of these decisions.  ""I will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart and in my soul that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.""","COVID inquiry: Five key moments from Nicola Sturgeon's testimony | UK News | Sky News Skip to content Sky News - back to home 1 Feb 10° 5° Watch Live Home UK World Israel-Hamas War Politics US Climate Science & Tech Business Ents & Arts Travel Offbeat Analysis Data & Forensics Videos Programmes Weather More Home UK World Israel-Hamas War Politics US Climate Science & Tech Business Ents & Arts Travel Offbeat Analysis Data & Forensics Videos Programmes Weather COVID inquiry: Five key moments from Nicola Sturgeon's testimony The UK COVID-19 inquiry is currently sitting in Edinburgh as it probes the devolved administration's response to the pandemic.

Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Mr Dawson asked Ms Sturgeon if using the pandemic to push for independence would be a ""considerable betrayal of the Scottish people"". She replied: ""If I had at any point decided to politicise a global pandemic that was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods, and educational opportunities, and had decided in the face of that to prioritise campaigning for independence, then, yes, it absolutely would have been as you described. ""Which is precisely why I didn't do it - I wouldn't have done it."" Ms Sturgeon refuted a claim that she wanted to be the person that drove COVID out, admitting that she took it ""very, very personally"" when her motives during the pandemic are questioned. She later said: ""People will make their own judgments about me, about my government, about my decisions, but for as long as I live, I will carry the impact of these decisions. ""I will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart and in my soul that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.""

1,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pa-man-arrested-decapitating-father-youtube-video-rcna136509,"A Pennsylvania man has been arrested after allegedly killing his father, before displaying his decapitated head in a gruesome YouTube video while spouting right-wing conspiracy theories.  Justin Mohn, 32, is accused of killing his father, Michael Mohn, police told NBC News. While police did not release the victim’s age, public records show him to be 68.  Mohn was taken into custody about 100 miles away from the crime scene on suspicion of first-degree murder, abuse of a corpse and possessing an instrument of crime with intent, according to a court docket released early Wednesday.  He was arraigned at 4 a.m. and denied bail, Middletown Township Police Capt. Pete Feeney said.  In the YouTube video, which was titled ""Mohn's Militia - Call To Arms For American Patriots"" and is cited in a police complaint, Mohn is seen wearing gloves and holding his father's head in a plastic bag. Later, the head can be seen in a cooking pot.  Mohn says his father was a federal employee for 20 years and refers to him as a traitor, calling for the death of all federal officials and attacking President Joe Biden's administration, the Black Lives Matter movement, the LGBTQ community and antifa activists. YouTube removed the video, which is more than 14 minutes long, hours after it was posted.  Justin Mohn in a video posted on YouTube. YouTube  In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said the video was taken down because of its ""strict policies prohibiting graphic violence and violent extremism.""  ""The video was removed for violating our graphic violence policy and Justin Mohn’s channel was terminated in line with our violent extremism policies. Our teams are closely tracking to remove any re-uploads of the video,” the statement said.  Prior federal lawsuits  Mohn has filed at least three lawsuits against federal agencies, including the U.S. government, claiming they negligently caused him to take out student loans between 2010 and his graduation from Pennsylvania State University in 2014, a court filing shows.  He paid a filing fee of $2,000 and, after his claims were dismissed, he sought to have the judge recused from the case because of what he claimed was a personal bias and a conflicting personal financial interest.  In a legal opinion on the case, the judge called the accusations “entirely speculative and without factual basis” and said Mohn’s complaints were the “inaccurate allegations of a disappointed college graduate.”  Mohn also sued his former employer, Progressive Insurance, in 2020, alleging wrongful termination and sex discrimination against men. He was hired as a customer service representative in October 2016 and was fired in August 2017 after he kicked open the facility’s doors, court records show.  A district court ruled that Mohn failed to establish a case of discrimination.  When Mohn was filing his lawsuit, his parents were giving him about $540 a month, he indicated in the court filing. Shortly before Progressive fired him, he had taken a trip to Vegas to see if he could pursue a music career, according to the lawsuit.  He represented himself in the lawsuits.  Mohn was highly active on social media, where he promoted his self-released music and books, including dystopian science fiction.  A nonfiction book released via Amazon in 2017, titled ""The Revolution Leader’s Survival Guide,"" contains the transcript of a letter to then-President Donald Trump warning of ""a peaceful revolution helped led by the author if positive change does not come to America and the world soon.""  Gruesome scene  The suspect's mother, Denice Mohn, found his father's body and called police around 7 p.m. Tuesday.  When police arrived at the family home in Middletown Township, they found Michael Mohn in a downstairs bathroom, decapitated, with “a large amount of blood around him,” according to a police complaint. A machete and a large kitchen knife were found in the bathtub.  Police found Michael Mohn’s head inside a plastic bag in a cooking pot in a bedroom next to the bathroom, according to the complaint. They also found bloody, clear rubber gloves in another bedroom. In the YouTube video, the suspect is seen wearing similar gloves.  A police officer guards the entrance to a house after a man was found dead in Middletown, Penn., on Tuesday. via WCAU  Denice Mohn told police that she’d last been home at 2 p.m. and that her son was the only person there with his father. When she returned to the home that evening shortly before calling police, her son was missing along with a car registered to her husband that had been in the driveway, according to the complaint.  Police later stopped Mohn in Fort Indiantown Gap, about 100 miles away from the crime scene, driving the car that was missing from the family home. Fort Indiantown Gap, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has a National Guard training facility.  “We didn’t know where he was going and what his intentions were when he left here,” Feeney said. “Fortunately, we were able to get a location based on his cellphone.”  The phone pinged near the Indiantown Gap National Cemetery and again just outside the National Guard base, where police found the car outside, Angela Watson of Pennsylvania's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which oversees the National Guard, said Wednesday.  Mohn had jumped over a fence and entered the base, she said.  The National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police were both contacted to help find Mohn, and officers took him into custody ""without incident"" around 9:25 p.m., Watson said. She added that Mohn was ""armed with a firearm."" No one was injured when he was on the base.  Middletown Township Detective Lt. Stephen Forman said police had had a couple of prior contacts with the suspect, some as far back as 10 years ago and some more recent.

The video, which has since been removed, was titled ""Mohn's Militia - Call To Arms For American Patriots."" Mohn, 32, was taken into custody about 100 miles away from the crime scene and is currently held on charges of first-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, and possessing an instrument of crime with intent. In the video, Mohn refers to his father as a traitor and attacks various groups, including federal officials, President Joe Biden's administration, the Black Lives Matter movement, the LGBTQ community, and antifa activists. The police found Michael Mohn's body in a downstairs bathroom with a large amount of blood and decapitated, with his head in a cooking pot in a nearby bedroom. Mohn had jumped over a fence and entered the Fort Indiantown Gap National Guard base, where he was taken into custody without incident around 9:25 p.m. The police stated that they had prior contacts with Mohn, some as far back as 10 years ago.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240131-penn-decapitation-mb-0920-308b45.png"
6,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/30/fossil-fuel-industry-air-pollution-fund-research-caltech-climate-change-denial,"The fossil fuel industry funded some of the world’s most foundational climate science as early as 1954, newly unearthed documents have shown, including the early research of Charles Keeling, famous for the so-called “Keeling curve” that has charted the upward march of the Earth’s carbon dioxide levels.  A coalition of oil and car manufacturing interests provided $13,814 (about $158,000 in today’s money) in December 1954 to fund Keeling’s earliest work in measuring CO2 levels across the western US, the documents reveal.  Keeling would go on to establish the continuous measurement of global CO2 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This “Keeling curve” has tracked the steady increase of the atmospheric carbon that drives the climate crisis and has been hailed as one of the most important scientific works of modern times.  The fossil fuel interests backed a group, known as the Air Pollution Foundation, that issued funding to Keeling to measure CO2 alongside a related effort to research the smog that regularly blighted Los Angeles at the time. This is earlier than any previously known climate research funded by oil companies.  In the research proposal for the money – uncovered by Rebecca John, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center, and published by the climate website DeSmog – Keeling’s research director, Samuel Epstein, wrote about a new carbon isotope analysis that could identify “changes in the atmosphere” caused by the burning of coal and petroleum.  “The possible consequences of a changing concentration of the CO2 in the atmosphere with reference to climate, rates of photosynthesis, and rates of equilibration with carbonate of the oceans may ultimately prove of considerable significance to civilization,” Epstein, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology (or Caltech), wrote to the group in November 1954.  Experts say the documents show the fossil fuel industry had intimate involvement in the inception of modern climate science, along with its warnings of the severe harm climate change will wreak, only to then publicly deny this science for decades and fund ongoing efforts to delay action on the climate crisis.  “They contain smoking gun proof that by at least 1954, the fossil fuel industry was on notice about the potential for its products to disrupt Earth’s climate on a scale significant to human civilization,” said Geoffrey Supran, an expert in historic climate disinformation at the University of Miami.  “These findings are a startling confirmation that big oil has had its finger on the pulse of academic climate science for 70 years – for twice my lifetime – and a reminder that it continues to do so to this day. They make a mockery of the oil industry’s denial of basic climate science decades later.”  Previous investigations of public and private records have found that major oil companies spent decades conducting their own research into the consequences of burning their product, often to an uncannily accurate degree – a study last year found that Exxon scientists made “breathtakingly” accurate predictions of global heating in the 1970s and 1980s.  The newly discovered documents now show the industry knew of CO2’s potential climate impact as early as 1954 via, strikingly, the work of Keeling, then a 26-year-old Caltech researcher conducting formative work measuring CO2 levels across California and the waters of the Pacific ocean. There is no suggestion that oil and gas funding distorted his research in any way.  The findings of this work would lead the US scientist to further experiments upon the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii that were to provide a continual status report of the world’s dangerously-rising carbon dioxide composition.  Keeling died in 2005 but his seminal work lives on. Currently, the Earth’s atmospheric CO2 level is 422 parts per million, which is nearly a third higher than the first reading taken in 1958, and a 50% jump on pre-industrial levels.  This essential tracking of the primary heat-trapping gas that has pushed global temperatures to higher than ever previously experienced in human civilization was born, in part, due to the backing of the Air Pollution Foundation.  A total of 18 automotive companies, including Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, gave money to the foundation. Other entities, including banks and retailers, also contributed funding.  Separately, a 1959 memo identifies the American Petroleum Institute (API), the US’s leading oil and gas lobbying body, and the Western Oil and Gas Association, now known as the Western States Petroleum Association, as “major contributors to the funds of the Air Pollution Foundation”. It’s not clear exactly when API started funding the foundation but it had a representative on a research committee from mid-1955 onwards.  A policy statement of the Air Pollution Foundation from 1955 calls the problem of air pollution, which is caused by the emissions of cars, trucks and industrial facilities, “one of the most serious confronting urban areas in California and elsewhere” and that the issue will be addressed via “diligent and honest fact finding, by wise and effective action”.  The unearthed documents come from the Caltech archives, the US National Archives, the University of California at San Diego and Los Angeles newspapers from the 1950s, and represent what may be the first instance of the fossil fuel industry being informed of the potentially dire consequences of its business model.  The oil and gas industry was initially concerned with research related to smog and other direct air pollutants before branching out into related climate change impacts, according to Carroll Muffett, chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law.  “You just come back to the oil and gas industry again and again, they were omnipresent in this space,” he said. “The industry was not just on notice but deeply aware of the potential climate implications of its products for going on 70 years.”  Muffett said the documents add further impetus to efforts in various jurisdictions to hold oil and gas firms legally liable for the damages caused by the climate crisis.  “These documents talk about CO2 emissions having planetary implications, meaning this industry understood extraordinarily early on that fossil fuel combustion was profound on a planetary scale,” he said.  “There is overwhelming evidence the oil and gas industry has been misleading the public and regulators around the climate risks of their product for 70 years. Trusting them to be part of the solutions is foolhardy. We’ve now moved into an era of accountability.”  API and Ralph Keeling, Charles’s son who is also a scientist, were contacted for comment about the documents but did not respond.","‘Smoking gun proof’: fossil fuel industry knew of climate danger as early as 1954, documents show | Fossil fuels | The Guardian Skip to main content Skip to navigation Close dialogue 1 / 1 Next image Previous image Toggle caption Skip to navigation Print subscriptions Sign in Search jobs Search International edition International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Show More News View all News World news UK news Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries Opinion View all Opinion The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters Sport View all Sport Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf US sports Culture View all Culture Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage Lifestyle View all Lifestyle Fashion Food Recipes Love & sex Health & fitness Home & garden Women Men Family Travel Money Search input google-search Search Support us Print subscriptions International edition UK edition US edition Australia edition Europe edition Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing About Us Environment Climate crisis Wildlife Energy Pollution ‘They were omnipresent in this space,’ said Carroll Muffett, chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law.

1,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canada-is-far-behind-experts-urge-national-suicide-strategy-1.6749223,"In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, major party leaders and some cabinet ministers, the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is calling on Canada to create a national suicide prevention strategy.  The letter was signed by 121 leading experts from 30 countries as members of the Partnerships for Life Global Initiative to Prevent Suicide and was endorsed by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention, Suicide Prevention Ottawa and all members of the Association of Chairs of Psychiatry in Canada.  Advocates are calling on Canada ""as a leading G7 nation"" to become a world leader in suicide prevention by creating a national program, something only around 40 other countries in the world have.  ""Suicide continues be a leading cause of death globally and the world is currently not on track to achieving the one third reduction in suicide mortality rates as laid out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" an IASP release stated.  In the letter, experts stressed the importance of ""a co-ordinated cross-sectoral strategy, led at the federal level,"" to address the nuanced challenges surrounding suicide prevention.  ""We are hopeful that this call will add momentum to Canadian efforts to enhance existing support for suicide prevention like the recent three-digit (988) national crisis line number,"" Dr. Mark Sinyor, associate professor at the University of Toronto and associate scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said in the release.  The IASP says more than 4,000 Canadians die by suicide every year and evidence suggests a national program is the ""optimal"" prevention method, with research indicating countries with a suicide prevention program often have lower suicide rates than those that don't.  An excerpt from the letter to Trudeau reads: ""The Government of Canada is undoubtedly giving suicide prevention substantial attention, for which we express our deepest appreciation. However, regrettably, we must also highlight the stark fact that, at a federal policy level, Canada is far behind other similarly resourced and even many, more poorly resourced, countries.""  IASP president Rory O'Connor added the organization recommends every country should adopt or make progress towards adopting a national suicide prevention strategy.  ""Suicide is a global public health concern, and as experts committed to saving lives, we recognise the significance of a concerted effort on a national level. Efforts such as this from Canada present a real opportunity for positive change,"" O'Connor said in the release.  The IASP added Canada should implement policies that limit access to lethal doses of over-the-counter medication and introduce guidelines for how to care for someone in hospital after a suicide attempt.  The organization also praised Canada for its ""cutting-edge research on understanding suicide and best practices in suicide prevention"" but said the country is still ""lagging behind its peers.""  The federal government passed a law in 2012 requiring the development of a national framework for suicide prevention that included a need to regularly report back to Canadians on the progress being made.  As it was crafted, the framework has three main objectives: reducing stigma while increasing awareness, connecting Canadians to information and resources, and accelerating the use of research and innovation in suicide prevention.  In the government's 2022 progress report, then-minister of mental health and addictions Carolyn Bennett noted work was already underway on ""establishing a national suicide prevention action plan.""  The plan, according to the government, ""will set out concrete actions and performance indicators to improve crisis support and suicide prevention for people most affected by suicide risk, attempt and loss.""  As of January 2023 when this status update was made public, the government had indicated it would be engaging with ""other government departments, provinces and territories, Indigenous communities and people with lived and living experience to inform the development of the action plan"" over the next year.  Current Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health Ya'ara Saks' office told CTVNews.ca the government has been taking steps since 2015 to support the mental health of Canadians.  ""Our hearts go out to all loved ones of those we have lost to suicide, and to those who struggle with suicidal thoughts. We appreciate the work being done by the International Association for Suicide Prevention and commend their efforts to contribute to improving systems and care.""  The government added it is ""continuing to engage with all partners, including Indigenous partners, to enable the co-development of actions that will have the greatest impact within communities.""  ""We want to ensure we get this right,"" the statement continued.
